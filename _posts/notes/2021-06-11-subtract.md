### Intro: The Other Kind of Change

- We add more than we subtract
    - Spend more time gathering info than distilling what’s there
    - Start more initiatives/activities than we phase out
    - Add new rules than we take away
    - Think more about providing for the disadvantaged than removing unearned privilege
- We neglect option of subtraction
    - Harder to see, often harder to implement
    - Ex. divesting in apartheid vs donating to anti-apartheid
- The difference between *less* and *subtraction*: the former is an end state, the latter is an action
    - Can reach “less” by doing nothing, but the more rewarding kind comes from actively subtracting

## Part I: Seeing More

### 1. Overlooking Less: Legos, the Lab, and Beyond

- Many experiments → we don’t subtract as much as we add. But why?
    - Do we *choose* to add, or not even see the possibility of subtracting?
    - Is adding the more *accessible* choice? Yes: giving people more time to think of ideas, or reminding them they can subtract → more likely to do so; decreasing bandwidth w distracting tasks → less likely to subtract

### 2. The Biology of More: Our Adding Instincts

- Intrinsic need to deal with our environment to feel *competent* (Richard White, 1959) → easier to show competence by adding
- Have an innate sense of more and less, before know how to mathematically add and subtract
    - We judge differences btw small quantities as more significant than differences btw large ones— more based on *relative* comparison (analogous to how other senses like vision & hearing work!)
    - When approximating, precision depends not on final amt but on quantity used to get there
- Using *set schema* limits possibility of subtraction (you can’t have negative items), vs a distance schema (can have negative temps)
    - Can reframe some scenarios to envision more subtractive options, such as with investing/divesting
- Still, many instances of subtractive thinking at play in “nature”
    - First instances of subtractive tool building ←→ development of abstract thinking
    - Synaptic pruning of neuronal networks

### 3. The Temple and the City: Adding Brings Civilization, and Civilization Brings More

- How civilization both arose from and is defined by the pursuit of more
- Recent theory: development of material culture (building monuments, temples) can *before* development of civilization (and agriculture, etc.)
- *Field dependence:* how much the “surroundings” affect our perception of a situation, also shapes whether we think about/choose subtraction
    - Seeing the field → less likely to neglect subtraction
    - Interesting to consider cultural differences, but evidence shows subtraction neglect is robust across groups and situations
    - More important = realization that we each contain multitudes, have independent and interdependent “selves” → can have access to different views of a situation, see the subtractive possibilities
- Goal = be able to view adding and subtracting as *complementary*, not either-or
    - Many problems arise when we try to resolve false contradictions— confining people/cultures into rigid categories

### 4. More-ality: Time, Money, and the Modern Gospel of Adding

- Economic forces priming is to add
    - Adding square footage to increase personal weslth
    - Keynesian economics of virtuous cycles of spending
- **Time famine:** filling our time with more and more; seeing the limit of subtraction as “saying no” instead of actually *removing* things; getting caught in the business trap
    - Ringing the “no-bell” vs making a “stop-doing” list
- Buying time (eg. by removing unpleasant events) → greater happiness than adding pleasant things

## Part II: Sharing Less

### 5. Noticeable Less: Finding and Sharing Subtraction

- *Post-satisficeable less:* going the extra mental steps beyond “good enough” (which usually came from adding to not good enough) often involves subtraction and leads to a cleaner, more efficient solution
    - Have to continue to *noticeable* less (which is perhaps beyond the equivalent amt of addition)
    - Ex. **Kate Orff** and redesign of Lexington
- Can try to change *valence* around subtraction by using different words: “carve,” “reveal,” “clean”
    - *Loss aversion:* losing $100 feels more bad than gaining $100 feels good
    - But less ≠ loss! And reframing it can emphasize this

### 6. Scaling Subtraction: Using Less to Change the System

- Dismantling racism = prime example of systemic subtraction
    - “Systemic racism” is redundant, as racism is institutional, structural, systemic → subtracting racism = changing the system
- In complex systems, small changes via subtraction → big outcomes
    - All else equal, *adding incentives for desired outcome  is less effective than removing incentives for the problematic one* (increasing vs relieving tension)
    - Kurt Koffka: “The whole is *something else* than the sun of its parts.”
        - Ex. removing a bridge can increase or decrease traffic, bc depends on so many complex variables like human behavior in addn to capacity
- Subtracting unnecessary detail → helps us clarify places and ways to intervene → get at essence of our goal
- **Checklist for subtraction:**
    1. Subtract detail *before* trying to change the system (triage)
    2. Persist to *noticeable less* (music)
    3. Consider subtracting *first* (Jenga)
    4. *Reuse* your subtractions! (donut holes)

### 7. A Legacy of Less: Subtracting in the Anthropocene

- How to balance physical limits to growth (planetary boundaries) with urge to progress, innovate, improve quality of life?
    - *Progress can come through subtraction*
- Lessons we can learn from principles of subtraction…
    - Add *Remove* as first R to *Reduce, Reuse, Recycle* → zero is not an unbreachable baseline
    - Cannot rely just on climate engineering (ex. geoengineering) without also considering subtractive measures
    - *Noticeability challenge:* hard to see reduction in emissions! Important to visualize changes (or lack thereof) to get feedback)
    - Move beyond GDP growth as a measure of success — doesn’t account for useful less, and includes harmful more

### 8. From Information to Wisdom: Learning by Subtracting

- Pandemic of information fatigue… Herbert Simon → “a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.”
- Recent studies showing that poor people do indeed make worse decisions— but *because* of the mental scarcity from being poor, not leading to being poor
- Strategies of storing, summarizing, sorting can all help, but only *selecting* is a truly subtractive approach
    - Ex. filtering out unusable data (no use → not information)
- Opportunity cost of information— what to keep and what to get rid of?
- Tips!
    - Take less notes :) Trust yourself to remember the important stuff!
    - Prune concepts down to their essence (mechanics is all F=ma)
    - Subtracting is required to make revolutionary change in ideas— and using analogies can help!
