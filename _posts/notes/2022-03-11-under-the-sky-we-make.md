- Science won’t save us— we will, need to shift from exploitation to regenerative mindset
- Part 1 = facts (brain), Part 2 = feelings (heart), Part 3 = solutions (hands)

## Part 1 (It’s warming, it’s us— how we got here)

- Carbon emissions from our daily actions will stay in the air, warming the planet, for at least 300 generations
- Climate = long term patterns of weather in a place
- Must learn to live within the biophysical limits of nature; see limits as opportunities
- Put *values* at the center of conversations— which are now moral, not scientific
- All part of shift to **regenerative mindset**… three principles:
    1. Respect and care for people and nature
    2. Reduce harm at its source, not by treating its symptoms 
    3. Turn impulse to build to building resilience 

## Part 2

- Feelings have their own wisdom
- Learned much about grief from death of close friend Paul Kalanithi, author of *When Breath Becomes Air*
- Difference between meaning and happiness- long term vs short term
- Order priorities by looking through the lens of carbon
- Everyone can make a difference in whatever field they are in
- Very anti-solar geoengineering

## Part 3

- Acknowledging climate privilege
- Personal behavior change AND policy change are necessary
- Internalizing personal responsibility and seeing other people’s actions are two key factors in inspiring change
- Less cars, less flights, more plant based diets are most important changes
    - Much bigger impact than recycling, reusable bags, etc.
    - Aviation must be reduced to stabilize climate!
- Electrify everything!
- Inefficiency of agriculture (esp. animal agriculture)
    - Land use = main driver of biodiversity crisis, extinctions
    - Fresh water overuse for irrigation, agriculture
- Agriculture = primary source of methane (animals) and nitrous oxide (fertilizers), more powerful greenhouse gases than CO2
- One solution: rewilding
- Economics favor short term benefits at the cost of long term harm
    - Need to incorporate morals into standard cost- benefit analysis
    - Can measure cost of fossil fuels in lives, not just money
- Putting a price on carbon is NOT sufficient to drive necessary change
- Vote with your money
    - Divestment
