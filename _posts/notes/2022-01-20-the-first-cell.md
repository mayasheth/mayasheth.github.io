### Introduction

- Little progress in cancer tx in the past 50 years
    - Exception is immunotherapy, but even this doesn’t widely apply and can have harsh side effects bc such efficient killing
- Focus must be on prevention and early detection, eliminating the *first* cancer cell

### Chapter 1

- Slash/cut/burn protocol of tx (surgery, chemo, radiation) is often extremely painful— how often is no tx or palliative care offered as an option?
- Limitations of cellular and mice models of cancer
    - “If you’re a mice and you have cancer, we can take good care of you.”
    - Major differences btw mice and humans = much faster life cycle, metabolism of mice vs humans; difference in environment of evolution
    - Immune systems evolved to combat different types of pathogens → different compositions
    - Therapies that work both *in vitro* and in clinical settings are usually general cytotoxic agents (not specific to a gene or physiological process)
    - Even PDXs not particularly effective
- Need for fundamental shift in approach to treating cancer- interdisciplinary, multi-faceted
    - Shift from studying animals → humans
    - Shift from chasing the last cancer cell → detecting the first
- Currently, too much dependence on leaders in the field, grant funding, mentors
    - Can’t get grant $$ without an animal model
    - Doctors need to spend more time with patients, understand the language of their illness, not just reaching for the first drug possible
    - Hippocratic Oath — “there is art to medicine as well as science”

### Chapter 2

- Critical states and self-organization of sand— grain that causes a sand pile to collapse is no different than the rest → metaphor applies to cancer initiation as well
    - Suggests need to examine overall health (the soil) in addition to the first cell (the seed)
    - Accumulation of DNA mutations, exposure to internal and external cancer-causing agents (including pathogens like viruses, mutations to proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes)
- Peto’s Paradox → mechanisms in large-bodied animals to prevent cancer
    - Value of comparative animals studies
- Cancer is a multi-organ disease almost immediately after it begins, even when confined to single site
- “The mist of aging” leading to cancer in the elderly — accumulation of mutations, decrease in functioning of immune system (like all biological systems with age), increase in number of senescent cells, tissue loss with age → spatial reorganization of cells

### Chapter 3

- Precision medicine? Due to such heterogenous response to drugs
    - Identity molecular features of “unicorn” exceptional responders
    - Requires saving biosamples of biopsies of tumors, microenvironment— not being done currently
    - However: few cases of one gene driving malignancy; such mutations often don’t have matched drugs; even if there is, response rate remains low; and response only may mean an added 6 months vs other therapies
- Clonal composition of cancer → no person has one cancer; why one therapy rarely works forever

### Chapter 4

- Research funding system is screwed up

### Chapter 6

- Responsibility of oncologists to give patients efficacy, to offer all (applicable) treatment options
    - Currently often lack of trust btw doctor and patient → patients and their families Google all sorts of things
- Hope can be as harmful a disease as cancer
- Shift focus from tx targeting single genes to big data, omics, detecting DNA/RNA/proteins from the first cancer cells
    - CTCs, microRNAs, etc.
