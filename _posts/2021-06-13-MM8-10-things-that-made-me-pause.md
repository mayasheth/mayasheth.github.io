Good morning, friends!

To start of your Monday morning, here's a quick list of ten things that made me pause. What stands out to you?

1. An archive of [words from other languages without obvious English translations](https://eunoia.world/?utm_source=densediscovery&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter-issue-140)— it’s immensely satisfying to read some of these definitions and just *get* it, and just as fascinating to not understand. In other words, they’re all cool. 
    - One example that resonated with me is the South African term **ubuntu**, which, [in the words of Nelson Mandela](https://theculturetrip.com/africa/south-africa/articles/understanding-the-meaning-of-ubuntu-a-proudly-south-african-philosophy/?utm_source=densediscovery&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter-issue-140), is “**the profound sense that we are human only through the humanity of others**; that if we are to accomplish anything in this world, it will in equal measure be due to the work and achievements of others.”
2. Nicholas Kristof has some thought-provoking words and eye-opening metaphors on [the Israel-Palestine conflict](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/opinion/israel-gaza-conflict.amp.html), and how it doesn’t have to be the way it is. 
3. Racial bias and ableism are built into many medical devices. [Some of these, like pulse oximeters, used to be designed for equity. What happened?](https://www.wired.com/story/pulse-oximeters-equity/?bxid=5fe4dded1129e1003e463664&cndid=63284670&esrc=manage-page&source=EDT_WIR_NEWSLETTER_0_DAILY_ZZ&utm_brand=wired&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_mailing=WIR_Daily_060421&utm_medium=email&utm_source=nl&utm_term=list2_p1)
4. Watch for smiles: [animals (safely) crossing highways](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/31/climate/wildlife-crossings-animals.html). 
5. Browse through [Paula Zuccotti’s fascinating archive](https://lockdownessentials.org) of what 15 items people said were most important to them during the pandemic. 
6. An interesting [critique of user-centered design](https://medium.com/readymag/why-user-centred-design-struggles-with-ethics-1500caf86d54), calling for a planet-driven, ethics-driven rethinking. The primary flaw? “What’s good for the user, may be awful for others.”
7. [40 Below Joe](https://40belowjoe.com/) makes what are essentially Dip' n Dots, but... coffee. I can't decide whether I'm sad this exists, really want to try them, or both. Thoughts?
8. A beautiful profile of a family in Colombia seeking growth and restoration by [planting thousands of native orchids](https://emergencemagazine.org/essay/the-forest-of-orchids/) on the mountainside. Like a fairytale, but real. 
9. [Helen Ahpornsiri](https://www.helenahpornsiri.com/portfolio) gathers and presses wildflowers and ferns to create lovely, intricate depictions of plants and animals. Having worked with collage a bit recently, I'm in awe of how detailed and delicate these compositions are— and inspired to collect some flowers of my own!
10. Finally, a quote to ponder— I found this particularly relevant to my life at the moment. 

> The worst labyrinth is not that intricate form that can entrap us forever, but a single and precise straight line. (Jorge Luis Borges)

That's all for today! As always, I love to hear any thoughts, likes/dislikes, tangentially-related commentary, the coolest thing you've read of late, pictures of pets, etc.

Cheers!

Maya
