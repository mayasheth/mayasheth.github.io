### 1. A Boy with His Head in the Stars

- **David Starr Jordan** (DSJ) → grew up bringing order to Chaos
    - Born 1851, as a child loved & learned the stars (chose middle name Starr), made maps, studied flowers
    - Turned to collecting flowers after his father died
    - Just as Darwin was publishing
- Compulsive collective actually known to soothe stress & anxiety, gives a sense of personal efficacy even there seems to be none

### 2. A Prophet on an Island

- **Louis Agassiz** = Swiss geologist → early proposer of ice age theory, best way to teach science is through nature vs books
    - Every species = “thought of God” → taxonomy = translating His thoughts into human language
    - Nature holds moral code hidden in hierarchical organization of nature, and thus instructions on how to be better
    - Rank organisms via structural complexity (especially anatomy), relation to surroundings, social behaviors
    - Led to very racist views
- Held course on Penikese Island in MA for naturalists that DSJ attended

### 3. A Godless Interlude

- Author’s father’s worldview: (In the grand scheme of the universe...) *You don’t matter, so live as you please. While other people don’t matter, either, treat them like they do.*
- How do you find order and sense amidst the Chaos of the world?
    - Agassiz found it by God
    - Darwin did not: *Natura non favor saltum* → Nature does not jump
        - No hard lines or edges... makes the task of taxonomy seem impossible (so much grey area)

### 4. Chasing Tail

- DSJ → ichthyology, began work on taxonomy of fish, eventually became well-known for discoveries
- Asked by Stanford family to help with their “academic experiment” → first president of the university
    - Built Hopkins Seaside Laboratory
- Lots of exotic expeditions, discovered 1k+ fish species

### 5. Genesis in a Jar

- *Holotype* = preserved specimen of a species that represents it
    - Cannot be replaced if lost— replacement is a lowly *neophyte*
- DSJ’s obsessive push for discovery may have been fueled by grief over losses of friends, family
- Began losing support of Jane Stanford— didn’t think fish were that important— but then she died, and all was well

### 6. Smash

- Disastrous when earthquake destroyed collection of specimen— if unable to identify some when containers broke, would be lost to science until rediscovered

### 7. The Indestructible

- Kafka: the Indestructible = at the bottom of every person, keeps them going wherever they feel like going or not
    - Not related to optimism— deeper than that, less “self-conscious”

### 8. On Delusion

- The power of telling positively-biased stories about ourselves, holding (perhaps unjustified) positive opinions, “shield of optimism”
    - → healthier patients, more successful students and workers
    - Became marker of “well-adjusted” people, despite kind of being a delusion
    - Associated with *grit*, resilience
    - DSJ = example of how “a good dose of hubris is the best way of overcoming doomed odds”
- However! Recent research → might not be all that!
    - Positive self-illusions usually drive others away
    - Short term benefit, but masks long term accumulation of pain
    - Lash out more in response to criticism

### 9. The Bitterest Thing in the World

- DSJ behind Jane Stanford’s death?
    - Poison found in her system = same substance he used in capture of fish...
    - Her death never fully investigated

### 10. A Veritable Chamber of Horrors

- DSJ began to champion and spread idea of *eugenics*
    - One of first to bring it to America
    - Advocated for sterilization of the “unfit”
    - Believed life could “degenerate,” ex. sea squirts devolving from fish
- Eugenics overlooks value of *variation*
    - *Dandelion principle:* in some contexts, a dandelion is a weed to be killed; in others, it’s a valuable medicinal herb to be cultivated
    - Ecological complexity is often beyond human comprehension
- Supreme Court ruling in favor of government-dictated forced sterilization still stands

### 11. The Ladder

- Agassiz’s idea of a natural hierarchy with humans/gods at the top = countered by Darwin: no jumps in nature (no rungs on the ladder)
    - Some animals outperform humans at every possible potential measure of superiority (memory, recently evolved, tool use, altruism)
    - Perhaps DSJ clung to the concept for the vision and comfort of a natural order

### 12. Dandelions

- Psychiatric facilities from early 1900s = forerunners to concentration camps
- Dandelion principle → no single way to rank nature; depends on your perspective
    - “We matter,” in some of these!

### 13. Deus ex Machina

- DSJ = renowned as a pacifist— but this was motivated by eugenicist ends, the desire to “save” a nation’s best from war
- Ignored all the support and labor he received from immigrants, the poor (people he deemed “unfit”) in his scientific work
- Why is there no official taxonomic category for fish?
    - Not actually a deprecate group that broke off from the tree of life, but a collection of many branches from different origins, at different times
    - Ex. the lungfish is more closely related to a cow, which also has lungs, than to a salmon
    - Example of convergence

### Epilogue

- To unlock the *other world* that exists in this one, all you have to do is *stay wary of words*
    - The order we do seek does not ecist
