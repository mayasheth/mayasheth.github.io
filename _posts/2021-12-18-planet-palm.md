### Intro

- Palm oil and palm kernel oil permeate over 50% consumer products in the grocery store— how did we get here, and what is the impact of this industry?
    - Plant is semi-spontaneous in regeneration
- Part 1 will look at origins of industry, spanning back two centuries, from POV of "colonizer"
- Part 2 will look at it from the other side

## Part 1

- Development of palm oil trade tied tightly to "scramble for Africa," slave trade, etc.
- Commodified in soap starting with Lever (→ Unilever), margarine
    - One scientist defected to P&G and helped them make Crisco!
- Again, closely intertwined with atrocities in the Congo, etc.
- Also spread the oil palm to Southeast Asia, exploitation happened there as well
    - Unilever's plantation people imported thousands of weevils from Africa to Malaysia once they found out the insect was the palm's main pollinator → increase in yield
- Palm oil began replacing many other animal-based oils (butter, lard) in both industrial and home cooking
- Used widely in oleo-chemicals (in place of petro-chemicals)

## Part 2

- Land-grabs in Indonesia = state-sponsored; plantation owners profited and benefited from anti-Communist massacres in the 60s-70s?
- Deforestation/land-clearing to plant oil palms → so many endangered species, poaching in what little rainforest remains
- Currently: labor conditions are horrendous
    - Extremely low (if any) wages, exposure to toxic pesticides (organophosphates) and other dangerous conditions (electrocution, etc.) with little healthcare
    - Child labor, sexual assault, etc.
    - Palm oil produced under such conditions makes its way into consumer goods in many companies we interact with— Hershey's, P&G, Pepsico, etc.
- Murder and intimidation of union workers and strikers
- India = one of the largest importers of palm oil; contributes to obesity and diabetes epidemics
    - Both palm oil and palm kernel oil have ideal properties for frying and things like chocolate, respectively (in terms of taste, saturation, etc.)
    - Emphasis and use of palm oil takes place of healthier options— both in agricultural space and actual food people are eating
    - Cheaper than other plant/vegetable oils (sunflower, rapeseed, etc.)
    - Used in place of dairy products like ghee, etc., as dairy prices rise (often not advertised clearly)
    - Prevalent in food that's locally produced and from international brands— which use palm oil in countries like India but not in the US
- Similar trends in Mexico (obesity, cardiovascular disease)
- Use of palm oil as biofuel lead to surge in production in Indonesia → more clear-cutting
    - Everywhere became fair game for palm plantations
    - Not necessarily carbon-neutral if clearing rainforest, or esp peat land, to grow the oil palms for biofuels

## Part 3

- Efforts in place to try to have food labels be more transparent when "tropical" vegetable oils are in use, more info on health and environmental implications
    - Resistance from food companies, plantation companies
- Many certification schemes are not credible (rely on or influenced heavily by the companies they are supposed to regulate
