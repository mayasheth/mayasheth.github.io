- We are human only in conviviality with that which is not human → getting back in contact with the sensuous world is essential to orient ourselves with new technological tools
- *Phenomenology* — the study of direct experiences

### 1. The Ecology of Magic (A Personal Introduction)

- Studied relationship between magic and medicine among indigenous people in Indonesia
    - Those who practiced magic maintained some level of suspicion about their intentions to ensure only those who truly needed help sought healing
    - Seen as managing reciprocal balance between humans and nonhuman world; both in terms of material exchange and praise, honor, etc.
    - Allegiance of magician/shaman not to the human, but wider web of interconnection
- Ethnocentric idea that the shaman’s work is “supernatural” denigrates nonhuman life, rivers, etc. to inert— in reality, “magic” manifests *from* nature in all these forms
    - Tribal magician defined by ability to shift out of perceptual boundaries & awareness, to be able to experience  without bias those of other powers of the land
    - *Magic = experience of living in a world of multiple intelligences* (all entities are experiencing forms)
- Experienced deeper attunement with the wider world through encounters with fireflies, ants, spiders
- Current intensity of physical and psychological distress in society has as its source our imbalance with the natural world— destruction of biodiversity, climate change → need to turn our focus from our own technologies, which only reflect ourselves back to us, to nature

### 2. Philosophy on the Way to Ecology

- Idea that things we can perceive— ex. a tree— exist when we aren’t directly there seeing it, because of all the other entities that are perceiving it, including the cells of the tree itself
- *Life-world* = our default experiences, primordial and collective, before the cognitive layer of theorizing and conceptualizing
    - Inherently subjective, but when we talk about it, easy for science to overlook our active role
- Reciprocity of senses: we can experience things only because we are entirely part of the sensible world we are in (and in turn can be sensed by all else)
    - Reflected in indigenous language— speaking *to*, not about, the environing earth (rocks, water, etc.)

### 3. The Flesh of Language

- *What is language?* Difficult question, because the only way to define language is with language itself
- **Language = gesture**, no more ideal than physical sounds or movements— we learn our native language *bodily*, not mentally, figuring out what the meaning of words *feel* like
    - Eur philosophy → preoccupation with “what makes humans unique” → often point to language, removing this conception, but this overlooks the many other species with sophisticated vocal communication
    - Redefining language as gesture...

    > Thus, at our most primordial level of sensuous, bodily experience, we find ourselves in an expressive, gesturing landscape, in a world that *speaks*.

### 4. Animism and the Alphabet

- How, then, have we become so disconnected from nonhuman nature?
    - Not an inevitable happening— evidenced by thousands of years that indigenous people inhabited North America without ecological destruction
    - Sep between human and environment → roots in ancient Hebraic and Hellenistic philosophy... both cultures which used the technology of the *alphabet*
- Shift from pictographic writing to phonetic alphabet → opens distance btw human culture and nature:  *creates link btw written character and vocal gesture bypassing completely the sensible phenomenon*
    - Contrasts with the participatory, animate earth depicted in Homer’s epics— clouds, ocean, sun, all instructive or symbolic of gods
    - Early example of permanent, unchanging human technology
    - Inert letters have replaced nonhuman animals, plants, rivers in “speaking” to us— written letters = magic that cast a *spell*
- Socratic dialectic → ask a speaker to explain what they said — separate themselves from the formulas and habitual phrases

### 5. In the Landscape of Language

- Examples of cultures that still live within an animate environment, not replaced by written word
- Much more attuned to and observant of surroundings, interact with other animals (ex. communicate w each other and other animals with bird calls)
- Arctic **Koyukon** → highly onomatopoeic language, names for birds sound like their calls
    - More careful with their words, the power of language— since other animals speak, they can also hear and understand us talking
- **Apache** → land itself is a guardian of the right behavior— “moral efficacy of the landscape” to ensure mindful, respectful behavior
- **Aboriginal Australians** → we ourselves are participants within the vast imagination (*Dreaming*) of the world
    - Stories embedded in landscape: visible and tactile, but also auditory; ancestral tracks with distances measured in lengths of songs
    - Inherent, at birth, a particular stretch of song and corresponding land → responsible for keeping it as it was when initially sung into existence
    - Songs/stories = mnemonic for remembering location of important geographic locations (ex. water!), and vice versa (transmission of cultural knowledge)

### 6. Time, Space, and the Eclipse of the Earth

- When stories began to be written down, letters replaced the land & place as mnemonic activator → gave way to idea of *abstract, homogenous space* and *abstract, linear time*
    - In contrast to very cyclical nature of time in oral cultures, place-based conception of space; integrated time-space
- Written text in the form of the Hebrew Bible → “portable homeland” for the Hebrew people, only way they have been able to preserve their culture while in perpetual exile
- Where can we locate *the past and the future* within the visible landscape? How do we perceptually distinguish them?
    - Both existing just beyond the horizon? (Literally)
    - Heidegger → the future *withholds* its presence, the past *refuses* its presence
    - Sensory phenomena are continually *appearing out of,* and *vanishing into*, two invisible realms: *vast openness* (beyond the horizon, the future) and *packed density* (hidden underground, the past)
    - Ultimately the two are one and the same → cyclic nature of time

### 7. The Forgetting and Remembering of the Air

> What the plants are quietly breathing out, we animals are breathing in; what we breathe out, the plants are breathing in. The air... is the soul of the visible landscape, the secrets realm from whence all beings draw their nourishment.

- Invisibility and omnipresence of air → very sacred in indigenous oral cultures
- Identification of air with awareness: overlap in meaning of words derived from *psyche*, *animus*, *atman*
- Hebrew scripts omitted vowels → reading still required active participation, interpretation, which was lost when Greeks included vowels in their alphabet/texts... “dissolving the primordial power of the air”
- Languages evoke *boundaries*, membranes between groups of people, between people and the terrain(different degrees of permeability)
- Pollution of the atmosphere symbolizes our disconnect with the air and lack of acceptance of interdependence

### Coda: Turning Inside Out

- Human language evolved in an animatic context, connecting us with each other and the wider world → cutting off the latter is stifling our direct experiences

> [A] story must be judged according to whether it *makes sense*. And “making sense” must be understood in its most direct meaning: to make sense is *to enliven the senses.*

- Only at the scale of our direct, sensory intx with the land can we respond to the needs of the living world— vs centralized, top-down programs
- Change taking place with people who have “fallen in love outward” (Robinson Jeffer’s phrase)
- Our job now is to write language back into the land— “*to plant words like seeds, let language take root, once again, in the earthen silence of shadow and bone and leaf.*”
