- “I could see why respect was better than niceness, and why I couldn’t have both.”
- Growing up, “silence was punishment, confession was connection, and criticism was love.”
- “If you want to know what someone is feeling, ask. And when you tell them, believe them.” → what his father told him, but really not the case...
- “With the unvarnished truth, answers require no hesitation.”
- You can’t convince people to love you by being right.
- *Etiquette* seen as a complex system of rules for being dishonest, barrier for people from other groups to fit in
- Honesty → no weighing of different kinds of pain, gambling on what is kindest (vs being honest, don’t have to worry about other people’s feelings)
- Chekhov always making people feel good about themselves
- After a period of time if dishonesty, fell back into patterns of honesty— but softer, making sure to empathize with the person he was being honest with
    - Followed one rule— read whether the person wants honesty or not
