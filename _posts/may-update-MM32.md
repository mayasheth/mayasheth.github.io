Hey friends,

Happy Memorial Day! I don‚Äôt have a ton to share with y‚Äôall this month, but onward to my top five links of May and a few books I‚Äôve read/listened to/am in the midst of. 

What‚Äôs new in your world? If you have time, share with me the last thing that made you smile. For me, it was a picture of my brother‚Äôs puppy on a fluffy new bed üôÇ

Cheers,

Maya

### Books

- *Black Ops* ‚Äî Ric Prado
    - [The Life of a CIA Shadow Warrior]
    - Somewhat unsurprisingly, a very masculine style of writing, it that‚Äôs even a thing, with an oversimplified depiction of morality
    - Still, a thrilling and disconcerting insight into parts of the world I never experience
    - The goal of the book seems to be: the movies get the CIA wrong, here‚Äôs how and why in real life, it‚Äôs even more badass.
- *Making a Scene* ‚Äî Constance Wu
    - A memoir read by the author‚Äî my favorite type!!
    - So far, vignettes of her relationships with several influential figures in her life
    - I so relate to her experience of trying sooo hard to fit in and not ‚Äúseem‚Äù Asian that when people (on TV or real life) did, I‚Äôd almost get angry at theM
- *Catch and Kill* ‚Äî Ronan Farrow
    - [Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators]
    - Another sorta memoir, read by the author
    - Gripping, terrifying, heart-wrenching. An account of the reporting of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein‚Ä¶ at times, this seemed more like a fictional story than reality. There are so many mysterious and dark forces at play in society‚Ä¶ always good to have a reminder of that.
