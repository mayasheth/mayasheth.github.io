Happy new year, friends!

The first Musings of 2022 include some personal goals and reflections, a couple cool creative pursuits, and several fascinating environmental reads...

How’s the year been treating you? Any interesting adventures thus far? Let me know!

Cheers,

Maya

### Thoughts for the new year

- [Some reflection on my values](https://mayasheth.github.io/2020/11/20/values) for the new year, including how I did on last year’s intentions and what to focus on in 2022
- Life goals: [hiking the triple crown of America’s trails in a calendar year](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-11-19/how-2-stanford-students-conquered-the-triple-crown-of-hiking?utm_source=pocket_mylist), like these Stanford students did. Maybe not this year, but soon!
- Important question— should I start a [collection of elements](https://luciteria.com)?

### Creative things

- [An update on Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html), and some background on how the fast-growing trend was created (you  may have come across some of the many other articles written about the game recently, too)— we got into this early, y’all!
- Topher Payne provides [alternate endings to potentially problematic children’s books.](https://www.topherpayne.com/fixed-it) Check out his version of *The Giving Tree*…
- Christopher Payne’s [photos of manufacturing and industry](http://www.chrispaynephoto.com/) are spectacular (I assume no relation to Topher Payne?)
- [Cool art](http://www.salvagedesign.net/) by Connecticut artist Kristen Meyer

### Environmental reads

- An interesting dive into the [terrapin turtle smuggling industry](https://hakaimagazine.com/features/taking-down-a-turtle-trafficker/?omhide=true&utm_source=Hakai+Magazine+Weekly&utm_campaign=9b9de9c767-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_09_06_COPY_03&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0fc1967411-9b9de9c767-121668550)— some of the wildlife trafficking stories out there are just so… wild, there’s no other way to describe it. And these things are happening so close to our lives!
- Off-shore oil rigs are dangerous and very potentially hazardous— but they also [provide an excellent artificial reef environment to many marine creatures](https://hakaimagazine.com/features/oil-rigs-are-a-refuge-in-a-dying-sea/?omhide=true&utm_source=Hakai+Magazine+Weekly&utm_campaign=9b9de9c767-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_09_06_COPY_03&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0fc1967411-9b9de9c767-121668550). The question of what to do with decommissioned rigs isn’t as black or white as it seems…
- [Why bats](https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/BATS/qzjpqglbxpx/) are the ideal hosts for disease-causing viruses, grounded in impeccable and beautiful graphics in this article from Reuters.
