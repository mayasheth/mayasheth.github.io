### Intro

- America, since its founding, has operated on boundless expansionism, from the physical frontier to technology to military
- Talk of the frontier = talk of capitalism, endless growth

### 1. All That Space

- Belief that America could avoid market distortions from overcrowding like in Europe with near infinite ability to expand
- Absolutely brutal treatment of indigenous peoples
- Can a nation be both vast and virtuous?
    - Montesquieu: no, too many considerations will overwhelm the common good
    - Madison: yes, these considerations *are* the common good
    - Also Madison: expanding the “sphere,” essentially spreading people out, will limit power coalescing in a tyrannical majority or minority
- Always: expansion as the answer to the problems of expansion

### 2. The Alpha and the Omega

- Louisiana Purchase → both national security benefits and more rapturous, setting a virtually nonexistent border so far away
- Expansion included subjugation, dominion over “nature”
- Restraint with property rights, no restraint with territorial rights

### 3. A Caucasian Democracy

- US inherited all GB’s treaties with indigenous people, then made scores of their own … widely ignored by states
- Jacksonian era → subjegation of black peoples, rise in power of white men → heights of racism known thus far
- Indian Removal Act → 25 million acres turned over to US
- Building pressure on all frontiers of the country
- Indigenous people considered not foreign states nor states of the union, but something else undefined
    - Similar ambiguity with “Indian Country” and internationally recognized US borders
- Never before had white men been so free wrt property, expansion, land; defined their liberty in opposition to people of color they oppressed

### 4. The Safety Valve

- Steam boats moved people west even more rapidly, metaphorical safety valve for the Constitution
- Frontier also metaphorical safety valve for race and class tensions
- “The West was America’s asylum.”

### 5. Are You Ready for All These Wars? (The Cause of the Cause)

- Texas = epitome of Jacksonian democracy before annexation
    - End of reverse Underground Railroad, enslaving free blacks
- JQA → most powerful anti-war speech in US history after loss of presidency to Jackson once he was elected to HoR
- Mexican-American War = much more costly than usually described, contributed to momentum to Civil War
    - Gave US full Southern border

### 6. The True Relief (A Kind of Life Not Incompatible with Health)

- Many barriers to operating the Freedmen’s Bureau
    - Grant → Dominican Republic could be replacement for the Bureau

### 7. The Outer Edge

- Germ Theory: straightforwardly racist, one of ascent of Saxons across the continent
- Evolution of the word “frontier,” beyond a political boundary, into something more expansive and fuzzy— a cultural zone
- Historian Turner establishing ideas of common person beyond Jacksonian racism, lots of philosophizing on the frontier, de-emphasized brutal racism as driver of expansion (sort of eliminated this reality), dismissed slavery as essential to building the nation
- As continent began to fill, idea of the frontier expanded to public policy, to international territories (Sp Am War, South America)… imperial republic

### 8. The Pact of 1898 (Peace Among the Whites)

- One of few things Northerners and Southerners agreed upon after Civil War = **Manifest Destiny**
- Continued racism in the South with Jim Crow; tension over black soldiers from wars in PR, Cuba
- Demand for Confederate flag grew with wars of early 1900s through WWII and Korean War (till Vietnam), when original meaning returned
- Military expanded American frontier, and became its own kind of frontier, giving all soldiers  access to education, etc.

### 9. A Fortress on the Frontier

- Borders can’t stop historical change, but highlight moments when history changes direction
- Land in Texas distributed to white settlers, while export agriculture displaced much of the rest of Mexican residents
- Mass murders of Mexicans (indigenous people, Spanish descent): lynching, executions
- Migrants treated terribly, “deloused” in procedure similar to gas chambers in WWII
- KKK → “frontier facism”

### 10. A Psychological Twist (To Subdue the Social Wilderness)

- FDR influenced by writings of Turner
    - New Deal → socialization of frontier thesis
        - De-exceptionalized US history
        - More inclusive (despite removing Native Americans from many parts of New Deal for political reasons)
    - WWII → wrapping up reform movements w migrants, bc low cost labor for agriculture required
- After war, attempts to pass human rights faced opposition

### 11. A Golden Harvest

- “Frontier” lost any negative associations post-war, began again to mean a boundary to be crossed
    - Frontiers of the mind, science
    - Security frontier around the world (Cold War) — liberal multilateralism
- Treated developing countries in its sphere as the old western frontier— under domain of Department of Interior
- Legislation over migratory birds → tension between conservatives and liberals, federal and state govts (fitting, because also tension over migrants)
- Puerto Rico’s attempts to constitutionalize right to work shows failure of social democracy in US

### 12. Some Demonic Suction Tube

- Vietnam— another frontier war
- King’s speech against Vietnam and expansionism in general was almost a call and response with JQA’s on who would pay for these frontier wars
    - Criticized for mixing civil rights and foreign policy, even though they were closely related (ex. how Vietnamese were treated, violence within ranks of US soldiers)

### 13. More, More, More

- Reagan, individual rights >>>, libertarianism (triumph of Austrian School)
    - Brutal policies abroad, esp C and S America, but “sunny” persona domestically
- Koch brothers getting involved
    - Working against environmental regulations
- Again, vigilante brutality and racism against migrants

### 14. The New Preemptor (Divided in Grabbing, United in Holding)

- “NAFTA = 20th century frontier”?
    - Things exported from US to MX for processing and back from MX to US only taxed for what was added— occasionally only very cheap labor, as in making clothes
- Idea for a fence/wall on the border
    - Militarization of safe crossing points
    - Other passages became much more dangerous and deadly
    - Seasonal migration decreased → once migrated, wanted to stay
- Beginning of deportation regime of migrants that exists today under Clinton

### 15. Crossing the Blood Meridian

- Pattern of abuses to migrants, virtually murder and torture, human trafficking
    - By officials and vigilantes alike

### Epilogue

- Border/frontier isn’t just the border, but the entirety of South America; airports; etc.
    - All checkpoints deep in the country
