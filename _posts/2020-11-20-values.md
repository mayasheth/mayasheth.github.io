The fundamental principles that I want to drive my decision-making. Trying to be transparent about what I care about-- to make myself think about it, as a reminder, for accountability, and... because I can be.

## Connection
LOVE  // FAMILY  // FRIENDS // ECOLOGY // GRATITUDE // FLEXIBILITY

Have the mental energy and flexibility to cultivate close relationships // Give and receive love freely

**Practice this now:** Text people back // Write letters and send mail // 5+ gratitudes a day // Ask for critical and honest // feedback  Practice “attempathy”

**So I can do this later:**  Be a role model and mentor for Sophie, Anya, and Bela // Live carbon neutral // Visit NYC and go to fancy places // Get another puppy 

## Authenticity
CONGRUENCE // HONESTY // GROWTH  // COURAGE // INDEPENDENCE

Articulate my perspective // Stand by my values // Have the courage to be flexible // Say what I believe and do what I say

**Practice this now:** Anticipate 1-, 5-, and 10- year consequences of my actions // Do something once and not the next day 

**So I can do this later:** Live with choice in line with my values // Make decisions with intentionality and conscientiousness //  Maintain legal independence 

## Challenge
PERSEVERANCE // PURPOSE // MASTERY // ACHIEVEMENT // RESPONSIBILITY

Make an impact on the world // Push the limits of what I can do // Have a purpose & embrace responsibility 

[“Do more.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwYy4scOJi8)

**Practice this now:** 1+ min ice cold showers // Read 2+ research articles a week   

**So I can do this later:** Train for a marathon, triathlon, big hike // Dive deep into research 

## Adventure
CREATIVITY // CURIOSITY // EXPLORATION

“To travel is to explore without a hypothesis.” 

Be a life-long learner // Keep on with scientific discovery // Pursue my interests, no matter how random // Actively seek wonder // Explore my physical, intellectual, and creative worlds // Be still to do artful things 

**Practice this now:** Draw once in awhile // Go outside every day // Keep reading 

**So I can do this later:** Go to Patagonia // Surf camp in Costa Rica
