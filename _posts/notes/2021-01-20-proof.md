### Introduction

- The Aviation → pre-Prohibition cocktail = gin, lemon, maraschino liqueur, crème de violette
- Chemists from UC (Cincinnati!) discovered flavor differences btw pure vodkas (comprising only ethanol & water) depend on strength oh hydrogen bonds btw the molecules!
- “The human relationship with alcohol is a hologram for our relationship with the natural world, the world that made us and the world we made.”

### Yeast

- *Cerevisiae* of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* derives from *cerveza*— beer, which it was used to make
- Science of fermentation of beer was simultaneous with research into metabolism, biochemistry, cell bio (Pasteur, Schwann, Koch)
- Phylogeny of yeasts → domesticated initially in Africa 12k years ago, then sake yeasts branch off, then wine → clusters of strains that make same product
- Artificial selective pressures → optimized enzymes in fermentation pathways

### Sugar

- Must break starches down to sugar before yeas can ferment it into alcohol (whether grain → beer, rice → sake)
    - Most cultures use some simple sugars directly to produce alcohol (fruit, agave, even horse milk)
    - Japan: *koji* (*Aspergillus niger*) turns rice to sugar; turns out to be much more efficient than European method (malting) at doing the same to grains
- Grape = ideal fruit, bc high sugar, grows well, interesting flavors, mostly pulp
    - Few esters (unlike apples), which are destroyed during fermentation → esters *created* during the process
    - All wine-making varieties = *cultivars* of same species
- *Malting* = turning barley to sugars (barley is ideal grain over wheat, corn, oats)
    - Used to make whiskey— basically distilled beer
    - Trick the seed into thinking it’s sprouting → releases enzymes like amylases to break starches into sugars, stop process before the seed metabolizes the sugars (as peat?)
    - Similar to what koji does— when analyzing genome/changes with domestication, found changes to metabolic enzymes involved w production of MSG (umami flavoring in miso, sake)
    - Now some attempts to make beer without malting, using enzymes → more efficient, cheaper

### Fermentation

- Yeast evolved to produce ethanol as byproduct perhaps to easily dissipate waste products (evaporates fast?) → happened to be suited to rise of fruits when angiosperms came around
    - Yeast are able to produce and consume ethanol!
- Different strains → different flavors (also dependent on conditions)
    - Yeasts “liberate”/make volatile many of the scent-producing compounds in juice
- Some fermentations also aided by bacteria (rum, esp bc made directly from cane sugar; wines)
- *Double dispense* → pour an almost full pint of beer (from the tap), let it sit for 3 min, then top it off off: liquid from second pour slips under first foam, pushing it up and sealing the new foam under, slowing CO2 diffusion → stiffer foam

### Distillation

- Challenging to maintain consistency of single malt whiskeys— can’t just change ratio of what you’re mixing! Depends a lot on standardization of distillation (≈ factory-like process)
- Distilling = concentrating, gets alcohol content up (after fermentation which usually maxes out at ~15%)
- Basic idea: vaporize the ethanol and interesting stuff (*congeners*) from water
    - *Azeotropic limit* = max proof of alcohol at 194.4, when vapor and water have same ethanol concentration
    - *Proof* just = 2x percent alcohol by volume in the US
- Different spirits distilled in different set ups- batches, continuous, diff numbers of pots or column, cycles
    - Column-bases still → allowed for fractional/continuous distillation, by adding ledges into neck of still
    - Art form = deciding when to make the cut points to keep the middle part that you drink
    - Copper used bc pulls sulfides out of solution

### Aging

- Aging in wood gives red wine, Scotch, cognac their “coconutty, round, lush mouthfeel” by adding **lactones**
- Also many other chemical changes
- Special rules for type of barrels (new vs old, type of wood, charred) to age Bourbon, Scotch in
    - Barrel-making is an art form in itself— choosing the specific tree, heating and cooling to bend wood, ultimately bound & watertight with no nails or glue (just flour)
    - Differences in heat, pressure → spirit loses different amounts of water or ethanol to wood
    - Cellulose and hemicellulose parts of wood break down into sugars, but lignin contains vanillins, other aromatic aldehydes (→ esters when mixed with acids, fruity & tart)  and tannins
- How to produce something that tastes old without aging?
    - Add extracts, steep wood chips, higher heat/humidity
    - Roll/rotate barrels for more contact

### Smell & Taste

- Extremely hard to describe how things smell— usually by metaphor, but even that’s incredibly individual and subjective
- Very little agreement even between experts when blind-tasting wine
- Aroma and flavor highly influenced by color
- Experts differentiated from novices more by their ability to *describe* flavor than actually identifying different wines
- Ethanol activates sweet and bitter receptors, but also acts as irritant → nocioception mechanism, independent of taste
- Olfaction is only direct sense, in that what stimulates olfactory neurons is a physical  part of what we are smelling
- “Wheels” of flavor/scent give us common language to describe what we sense
    - Can work with panel of tasters and flavor references to establish agreement on aromas → actually can distinguish wines by *terroir* (regionality/microclimate)
- Ultimate goal = map specific molecules to each flavor → figure out cheaper ways of getting what makes gives spirits their desired taste

### Body & Brain

- How to set up random, blinded trial to study effects of ethanol consumption?
    - Use cold vodka/tonic and tonic (people can’t tell difference)
    - Actually have four groups: based on what subjects *get* and what they *expect*
    - Expectations (what they perceived to be drinking) = critical to effect of ethanol
- Observable effects of alcohol are very predictable, but unknown mechanism of action for ethanol in the brain
