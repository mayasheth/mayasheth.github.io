- You know what you know— what Descartes calls “the holy music of the self”
- On addiction: “Absolution from end-stage chemical obsession tends to force otherwise faithless men to their knees.”
    - “In a broader sense, addiction can be enormously simplifying... It leads to a life that is, in a way, remarkably organized. What are we doing today? *Exactly what we did yesterday, give or take.*”
- Emerson’s credo: moderation in all things, especially moderation
- On life going by so fast: “...I was terrified of missing anything. I wondered whether my own personal velocity, the mad to-ing and fro-ing of my everyday life, was a fearful response to the thought that life would get away from me.”
- **The fallibility of memory**
- “You can’t become normal by pretending you are.”
