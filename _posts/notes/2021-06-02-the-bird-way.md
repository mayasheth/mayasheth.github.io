### Introduction

- Exploration of five arenas of daily activity for birds: talk, work, play, love, parenting
- Important to acknowledge individuality in behaviors— not all birds of a species act the same
- Focus on extreme behaviors → outliers offer perspective on what’s typical, indicate ingenious adaptations
    - Many Australian species! Aussie birds occupy more ecological niches than others → longer lived, more intelligent
    - C & S America → greatest diversity of birds, many unique behaviors
- How to measure intelligence in birds? Behavioral flexibility = how inventive the species is in its natural environment, whether it makes use of new things to solve problems
    - **Novel or unusual behavior is often intelligent behavior**
- How do birds have capacity for such complex cognition given small brain size?
    - More compact neurons: smaller, tightly packed, more numerous → efficient & high-speed sensory abs nervous systems
    - Concentrated in forebrain regions associated with intelligence → some parrots, corvids, have higher neuron counts there than monkeys!
    - Different approach to building powerful brains than mammals, which use larger neurons to connect distant regions
- Why so many new insights coming up now?
    - Shedding many biases that have limited research...
        - Human sensory bias on what birds can perceive
        - Geographic bias on studying mainly birds in northern regions, vs more diverse tropical species
        - Gender bias of male scientists mainly studying male birds
    - New tools/tech: sensors, cameras, DNA analysis
    - Study of *wild* cognition

## Talk

- May be capable of compositional syntax (ex. how “watch out” is different than “out watch”), but debatable

### Visual talk

- *Embodied words* → displays, gestures, postures
- *Cosmetic coloration* for sexual signalling with own secretions (Japanese crested ibis); applying mud to “paint” on feathers for camouflage, other functions (sandhill crane)
- Colorful facial plumage signalling identity (not an honest signal of fitness, as assumed initially) (queleas)

### Bird song

- Originated in Australia → all songbirds descendent from there!
- Birds generally better at recognizing sound and variations in it than us, have larger perceptive range
- Bell miners → create “wall of sound” to keep other species out of their territory

### Alarm calls

- Can encode lots of information— honeyeater alarm calls → 96 elements
    - *Mobbing* alarm calls (draws other birds toward threat) vs *fleeing* alarm calls (sends birds away)
    - *Functionally referential signalling* → can refer to specific environmental object or event (where or what kind of threat)
    - Encode what a predator is doing
- Specificity of black-capped chickadee calls: number of “dees” at the end → size and threat of predator (larger birds = less threat → fewer notes)
- Species of birds can understand each others’ alarm calls— even bird/mammals can understand each other, and species who have never encountered each other
    - Raises question of a universal language of alarm— but actually found that birds *learn* alarm calls from other species, like learning a new language!

### Mimicry

- Deception/lying takes lots of cognitive skill— requires theory of mind, learning, planning
    - Mimicry = sign of intelligence → honest signal of fitness in mating rituals
- Lyrebird = master mimicker
- Mimicry by some species thought to be passed on through cultural transmission, not just learned from environment— birds mimicking calls of other species no longer present!

## Work

### Sensory perception

- **Color vision:** birds = tetrachromatic, see an entire additional dimension
    - UV dimension adds distinction to leafy green in rainforests that are so hard for us to distinguish
- **Hearing:** asymmetric ears → positional info from sound, even for smaller birds than owls
    - Echolocation in audible range (oilbirds)
- **Smell:** extremely sensitive in several species— turkey vultures, tube-nosed sea-birds
    - Seabirds specifically can detect tiny amts of DMS → produced when krill consume phytoplankton, but also emitted by plastic → leads to consumption of trash

### Tools

- As always, initially thought to be uniquely human behavior, but more and more examples among birds
- New Caledonian crow → combines 2+ elements to make a tool, first time this was seen in any nonhuman animal
- Some species take advantage of wildfires → hunt the fleeing prey
    - Also (somewhat controversial) evidence of birds intentionally spreading fires as a hunting technique!

### Cooperative hunting

- **Antbirds** use knowledge of army ants to “raid” their hunts and get easy access to lots of prey; work in groups to facilitate these raids
    - Requires learning, memory, pattern-recognition, planning
    - Will return to past sites of raids to check that the ants have left, communicate among each other— long-term memory, cooperation
- **Mental time travel:** again, thought to be a defining human ability, but now it seems several bird species can engage in it too
    - Scrub jays and other caching birds remembering where and when they buried food stores
    - Spatial and temporal memories of hummingbirds to remember the hundreds of flowers they’ve already visited, how long it’ll take for nectar to replenish

## Play

- **Ravens** have reputation for being cruel, dark (a group is an *unkindness*!), but actually one of the most playful species of animals
    - Not naturally tool users, but can quickly learn
    - Show self-control, reasoning, flexible planning equal to great apes
- **Kea** of the parrot family = other extravagantly playful bird
    - Unlike ravens, extremely neophilic, social
    - Highly intelligent, innovative foraging, very long juvenile period— and juveniles hold higher social status than adults!
    - Very fluid social structures, not very hierarchical ← social intelligence ← social play

### What is play?

- Behavior that is not fully functional
- Often exaggerated, awkward, repetitive
- Spontaneous, voluntary, intentional, pleasurable, rewarding
- Only initiated when animal is not otherwise stressed
- Three kinds of play, in increasing complexity: *locomotor* play (with just the body), *object* play, *social* play (requires rules, no pain, taking turns); perhaps a fourth kind of *vocal* play?
    - Only documented in 1% of 10,000+ bird species!
    - Rare among animal phyla and species within those overall, suggesting multiple independent evolutions

## Love

### Courtship displays

- Include elaborate offerings, songs, dances by males
    - Palm cockatoo → only nonhuman example of using a tool for something other than foraging
- **Leks** = communal spaces for male courtship display, involve done very fancy examples (dance by bird of paradise)
    - **Bowerbirds** = lekking  birds, build ornate and decorated structures to attract mate; utilize illusions to capture attention!
- Sexual selection → traits of aesthetic beauty, rhythm, etc.?
    - Ultimately driven by experience and perspective of female bird, and her ability to judge displays is just impressive as the display itself!
    - Likely a combination of genes, honest signals, and beauty itself

## Parenting

- Wide variety of parenting styles, from none to group parenting
- Variation in egg design
    - Analysis of eggs → only three factors correlated w shape (when looking across all birds): body mass, evolutionary history, flight ability)
    - Within clades, other factors become more important
- Variation in nest style, building
    - Sophisticated behavior that can involve cooperation, planning, learning (from environmental cues to choose location, from past failures)
    - Nature vs nurture? As usual, both— experience usually helps more for birds that build complicated nests
    - Brush turkeys → build literal compost heaps and maintain exact temperature as incubator for eggs; mallefowl do similarly (utilize both microbes and solar heat)

### Brood parasites

- **Honeyguides** → cooperative relationship with human honey hunters in Africa— lead them to hive, and hunters leave then honeycomb wax, important food source
    - But also very dark parenting style— brood parasites, so lay eggs in nests of other species
    - Chicks then murder their nestmates quite brutally
- How do chicks of brood parasites learn to identify with their own species? Mother bird calls with *acoustic password* that primes development in auditory region of chick’s brain to learn species-specific songs
- Dynamics between brood parasites abs host species → evolutionary sense race of the host better distinguishing foreign eggs/chicks and the brood parasite better mimicking then
    - Some host species → individualized signatures on patterned eggs
    - If too hard to distinguish at egg level, some host species work at chick level to get rid of wrong species— somehow teach their own chicks special songs/passwords
        - Brood parasites chicks evolve to more closely resemble common hosts
- Host species from around the world have converged on common cuckoo alarm call → signal to mob!
- Brood parasites females require high degree of spatial awareness & intelligence to successfully reproduce, monitoring many nests at a time

### Cooperative parenting

- **Greater an**i: not among related birds which could be explained by kin selection → what leads unrelated birds to collectively raise their young?
    - Could be for protection vs large predators like snakes, crocodiles
    - Eggs of females who lay first eggs sacrificed for nutrients of the others → great deal of cooperation and coordination, communication and judgement
    - Individuals don’t even recognize their own chicks once hatched
    - Almost act as brood parasites on their own species → still in the process of coordinating reproduction perfectly?
- **White-winged chough** → require four helpers to raise chicks, engage in “chick-napping” to recruit enough birds for their cause!
    - Perhaps resulting from harsh, unpredictable envt
    - But for other species, could be because good envt has ample enough resources that populations were very large, easier for young to stay around parents and learn/help than go off on their own
