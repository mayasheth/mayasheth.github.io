This month has been quite the reading kick-off to 2021- being confined to my home has given me the opportunity to get through 26 books in their print, electronic and audio forms. I picked whatever I was in the mood for at the moment, and was pleasantly surprised by some of the interesting clusters that emerged:

- Books about families in suburban America with significant trees involved
    - *The Most Fun We Ever Had* - Claire Lombardo
    - *A Good Neighborhood* — Therese Anne Fowler
    - *White Elephant* — Julie Lanfsdorf
    - *[Fire in Paradise](https://mayasheth.github.io/2021/01/30/fire-in-paradise)*  - Alastair Gee
- Books about the Muslim experience in America and circumstances driving immigration
    - *Homeland Elegies* - Ayad Akhtar
    - *Mornings in Jenin* — Susan Abulhawa
    - *The Other Americans* — Laila Lalami
- Books with Christian missionaries
    - *Dissident Gardens* — Jonathan Lethem
    - *Fieldwork* — Mischa Berlinski
- Books about Americans traveling abroad, more generally
    - *Dirt: Adventures, with Family, in the Kitchens of Lyon, Looking for the Origins of French Cooking* — Bill Buford
    - *Let the Northern Lights Erase Your Name* — Vendela Vida
    - *The Lovers* — Vendela Vida
- Books discussing, at some point, the complexities of our sense of smell
    - *[Proof: The Science of Booze](https://mayasheth.github.io/2021/01/20/proof)* - Adam Rogers
    - *[The Reason for Flowers](https://mayasheth.github.io/2021/01/24/the-reason-for-flowers)* - Stephen L. Buchmann

In other news... some of my favorite quote-of-the-days:

- "The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change." — Carl Rogers
- "We are healed from suffering only by experiencing it to the full." — Marcel Proust
- "A day spent reading is not a great day. But a life spent reading is a wonderful life." — Ayad Akhtar, *Homeland Elegies*
- "Whatever you do won’t be enough... Try anyway." — Barack Obama, *A Promised Land*

And an random selection of other highly-recommended links, articles, and the like I stumbled across:

- ["There Are Two Kinds of Happy People"](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/01/how-balance-hard-work-and-pleasure-happiness/617847/) — Arthur C. Brooks, *The Atlantic*
    - I'm definitely one of these more than the other, and it's a good challenge to try to live a little more in the Epicurean tradition, too.
- ["Where Camels Take to the Sea"](https://www.hakaimagazine.com/features/where-camels-take-to-the-sea/?omhide=true&utm_source=Hakai+Magazine+Weekly&utm_campaign=63ad28ec53-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_09_06_COPY_02&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0fc1967411-63ad28ec53-121627405) — Shanna Baker, *Hakai Magazine*
    - What can this camel, a creature that is apparently native to my ancestral homeland, teach us about surviving in an extreme world?
- ["The definitive case for ending the filibuster"](https://www.vox.com/21424582/filibuster-joe-biden-2020-senate-democrats-abolish-trump) — Ezra Klein, *Vox*
    - Made me more informed, hopeful, and frustrated, all at once. It's always satisfying to feel any increase in understanding of how my world works.
