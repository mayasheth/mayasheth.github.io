Hey friends,

Some things I’ve learned through experience lately:

1. Squirrels can chirp like birds. 
2. I still don’t know what I wanna be when I grow up. 
3. Whales are so incredibly big. And playful! And individual. 

See ya around,

Maya

## books

- *Darkmotherland* — Samrat Upadhyay
    - 🇳🇵 Nepal book
    - Very long and very disturbing— wasn’t sure I’d make it through all 24 hours, but I surprised myself by starting to follow the characters a little more closely about half way through.
    - A lot of names and vocab I didn’t know the spelling of, which probably contributed to the slow start for me to get into it. Should have read the first chapter in text or something?
- *Orbital* — Samantha Harvey
    - Listening to this book felt a lot like watching Planet Earth, or maybe one of those space-themed IMAX movies at a museum? Beautiful and vast imagery, but with more existentialism than those examples. Not much plot to speak of, but it was sorta… atmospheric, maybe, and poetic, to listen to.
- *Blue Sisters* — Coco Mellors
    - Very pleasing audiobook narrator!
    - Hit harder than expected, some very relatable moments.
- *Someone Like Us* — Dinaw Mengestu
    - 🇪🇹 Ethiopia book
    - Started out a little quiet (purposefully?) but I was curious about the main character from the beginning…  This made the slow and subtle hints that he was a somewhat unreliable (to us, at least, and maybe to himself as well?) narrator that much more impactful.
- *Friday Night Lights* — H.G Bissinger [in progress!]
    - And I continue my quest of listening to books that popular TV shows / movies were based on (previously: *Masters of the Air*, *Killers of the Flower Moon*, *American Prometheus* /*Oppenheimer*…)
    - Another recurring theme: impact of sports on societal structures (previously: Spanish soccer & politics)
    - Odessa → one of many small towns in America, isolated from the big cities, defined by quintessential conservatism, individualism… tight-knit community (often centered on the church) and racism…
        - Terrible agricultural resources but happened to be on the Permian Basin → rode the booms and busts of the oil economy
        - What is there to talk about in towns like these? In Minnesota, it was hockey. In Indiana, basketball. In Ohio, Alabama, Texas, and many more, it was Friday nights.
    - Odessa’s Permian HS → winningest football dynasty at any level (as of 1988)… not the most skilled or strongest players, but the most fearless
    - Football was a crucial factor for  both why desegregation of schools was opposed  for so long (“redistributing the kids will ruin with the team!”), and how it eventually gained support (“they could be such good running backs, though…”)
        - The tragedy of high school sports & the false (for all but 200 kids a year) promise of going pro
