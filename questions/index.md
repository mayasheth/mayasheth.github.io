* ...when compared to crops domesticated by artifical selection?
* ...in the context of the American chestnut? The species is currently near extinction from a blight not "native" to North America. Crosses between blight-resistant Chinese chestnuts and the vulnerable American variety have been bred, but the resultant hybrids cannot be considered true American chestnuts. More recent efforts have introduced a singular wheat gene that confers resistance to the American chestnut, and the strain has thus far proven to fit identically into the ecosystem.  So, which is more natural? What about compared to things like Roundup Ready corn?
* ...especially given how widespread gene transfer is in the history of life? Our mitochondria aren't really "human"... We are able to develop placentae by "repurposing genes that an invading virus used to make a protective membrane around itself." Thus, human-induced GMOs might really just be one instance of an entirely natural instance of life.
