## Introduction

- History of art = question of *how we look*
    - Returning the viewers of art, not just the artist, into the frame
- What is *civilization*?
    - Deceptively difficult to define— often in terms of us vs them; a process of exclusion as well as inclusion
    - Idea of *barbarity* often used as a weapon, but “one person’s barbarity is another person’s civilization.”

## Part One: The Body in Question

- Focuses on art of the body, earliest depictions of men and women— what were they for and how were they seen?

### Portraying how to be a “good” person

- In Greek pottery, Images of people on functional objects like water jugs akin to modern advertisements, suggesting ideal ways of living, how to *be* a stereotypically good Athenian
- Other figures depicting mythical creatures like satyrs → bring up boundary btw civilization and its absence, human vs animal

### Antidote to death and loss

- Greek statues commemorating the dead
- Roman portraiture → some of first naturalistic depictions of faces, esp used in rituals of death, on coffins
    - Central halls of rich Roman houses = gallery to images of dead ancestors

### Terracotta warriors

- What were these for, if not meant to be seen?
- Each soldier is unique, but faces composed from finite sets of features— each one is not really a portrait of anyone, but rather likenesses

### Asserting power after death

- Egyptian pharaohs constructing massive images of themselves— Rameses II
- Images on external faces of the structures could be seen by anyone; like modern viewers, likely with some ridiculous or skepticism of actual extent of the ruler’s power
- Internal images only accessible to priests, inner circle— aimed at elite to remind them who’s boss, and to the pharaoh himself to reinforce sense of power

### The history of art

- Winckelmann → history of art parallels history of politics (and thus civilization); peak of both = Greco-Roman
    - Legacy → provides standard for western viewers to judge art id other cultures by; often distorting, divisive lens

## Part Two: The Eye of Faith

- Focuses on images of God abs gods, how all religions across time have struggled to depict the divine
- When does worship of worship of image turn into idolatry? What counts as an image of God, or God’s word? Where fires glorification of God end and worldly vanity begin? *What does it mean to look religiously?*

### Buddhist images at Ajanta

- Interpretation in original context— dimly lit, complex compositions— key to meaning
- Require active role of viewer to do religious work, find and follow characters and story of the Buddha
    - Enacting metaphor of searching for truth, faith amid darkness

### Early Christian art

- Asserts Christian message and power, combined with that of Byzantine emperor (ex. Justinian)
- Time of controversy over the nature of divine essence of Jesus vs God → San Vitale mosaics make strong case for Jesus’s divine status
- Christian art (ex. that of Tintoretto) → implications on role of charitable aims in religion— depict biblical scenes with poverty, putting viewer in the position of a beggar
    - Brings up question of idolatry— the more you glorify God through images, the more you are interested in the worldly and material over the spiritual and piety
    - How much is focus on statues of, say, Mary, on the *idea* of her rather than the image itself?

### Art and Islam

- Not an artless religion— home to intricate debates in aesthetics, the nature of beauty...
    - Question of how boundary of what art is acceptable can shift based on setting and context
    - Borderline between art and written word, with prevalence of calligraphy: when words cover surfaces of the mosque, not meant to be read, but perhaps to represent God through his art of writing, *as his word,* or as a blessing
- Modern-day Sancaklar Mosque → very untraditional in some ways (no dome or color, built into hillside); very traditional in others (only one man-made image, combination with natural form)

### Art and religious conflict

- Iconoclasm → destruction of religious imagery; of course this leads to tragic loss, but also makes the art into a visual narrative of religious conflict, balance between destruction and creation
- Islamic reaction to Hindu temples = more nuanced than simply destroying them
    - Also had fascination with Hindu art, reusing elements in their own structures
