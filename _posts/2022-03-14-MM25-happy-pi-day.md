Happy Pi Day!

Does anyone else remember how hyped we all got on 03/14/15 at 9:26? Or was that just me?

I’ve got a lot of varied topics for y’all to delve into today if you’re feeling it— pick and choose, and maybe try something you don’t have any interest in, just for kicks!

The spattering spring weather is making me excited for more warm days to come, and I hope the sun is bringing some joy into your lives, too.

Cheers,

Maya

### My birthday’s in October, but...

- I really, really, really want a [stair slide.](https://stairslide.com)
- Adding to my wishlist: the [Geodome 4 tent](https://sittingpretty.bulletin.com/north-face-geodome-4-tent/)— for interior decor or my nonexistent expeditions, I am uncertain.

### Science things

- [How waves work](https://nautil.us/the-power-of-the-waves-13180/)
- This was mind-blowing for some reason... [a possible reason why it’s so hard to concentrate in class after 45 minutes](https://whyisthisinteresting.substack.com/p/the-indoor-air-edition?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNTM4MzMyNywiXyI6IklRako1IiwiaWF0IjoxNjQ2MzI2Mzk0LCJleHAiOjE2NDYzMjk5OTQsImlzcyI6InB1Yi03MDAwIiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.F40u88_Gni7F_PdbZqrTLQFO8jfSw2ANlBGHAr7CIwQ).
- A [study conducted on zebrafish](https://www.quantamagazine.org/scientists-watch-a-memory-form-in-a-living-brain-20220303/?mc_cid=a06b98f73b&mc_eid=3f1e34114c) raises some complicating questions on how we understand the way memories form in the brain.
- More studies on fish, this time revealing [how flying fish evolved their fins and flying capabilities.](https://www.quantamagazine.org/flying-fish-and-aquarium-pets-yield-secrets-of-evolution-20220105/?mc_cid=a06b98f73b&mc_eid=3f1e34114c) I was most intrigued by the evolutionary mechanisms behind their flight, and how tiny changes in electric signaling during development can have such dramatic impacts.

### Psych-related things

- Melissa Santamaría uses her synesthesia to [visualize music in psychedelic videos](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/melissa-santamaria-digital-art-210222?utm_source=weeklyemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=intemail)
- The [psychology of Ikea](https://thehustle.co/how-ikea-tricks-you-into-buying-more-stuff/amp/)
- [How body doubles can help you get shit done](https://www.abc.net.au/everyday/how-body-doubling-tackles-procrastination/100840316)— I’ve definitely experienced this before, but never knew it had a name or how it worked!

### Current events?

- The move from carbon offsetting to [carbon insetting](https://www.voguebusiness.com/sustainability/gannis-carbon-rethink-offsetting-is-out-insetting-is-the-future?utm_source=thingtesting&utm_campaign=c76948d0e3-ISSUE_101&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_8aab527691-c76948d0e3-434785290)
- A very helpful visual guide to the [memberships of European states](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/a-visual-guide-to-europes-member-states/)
- On the [shortage of translators](https://restofworld.org/2021/lost-in-translation-the-global-streaming-boom-is-creating-a-translator-shortage/) in the global age of Netflix et al.

### Misc.

- [An interesting case against our culture of rationalism, and in favor of ritual and religion](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/in-praise-of-the-gods?s=r). I don’t know whether I agree, but the author makes some solid points in this essay.
- [Whales, in their death](https://longreads.com/2022/02/22/bones-bones-how-to-articulate-a-whale/?_kx=ro9glMUgdtYvz_3cBz6mQcPSHrXszncA1-o1bnXBns8%3D.Th5NuW) (a long-form essay worth a read (or at least a skim))
- A very informative and interesting [guide on olive oil](https://fat.gold/guide/)— or, should I say, olive juice?
