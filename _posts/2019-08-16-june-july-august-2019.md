A couple notes to start things off: Special thanks to my one and only reader for reminding me about doing this! Second, apologies to my family: I know it’s time to write about what I’m reading when half the things I say start with “This book I just read talked about...”, and I’ve surely passed that threshold in the last few weeks. 😉

The collection of books I’ve read recently (see below for the full list from the past three months) makes up what I just learned is probably a “small-world network.” That is, most are clustered around similar topics (the environment, politics, philosophy, medicine, dogs), with a few linking the disparate fields together.  Other examples include the neurons in our brain, actors in movies (Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon?), online social networks, and real life social networks (interestingly, behaviors like smoking also propagate along these!).

 If I were more motivated, I’d draw out a graph to prove my books were one of these... but I’m not. Instead, here are some of the coincidental and maybe interesting links that emerged, and also (as usual) random things I thought were cool.  Most of these are concentrated from the most recent readings, since… memory, and all. 

* The oh-so-clever line “...research... or rather, just search!” to highlight the novelty of an investigation. (*Loonshots, How to Do Nothing*)
* “In God we trust. All others [must] bring data.” — attributed, respectively, to NASA and surgeon Bernard Fisher. In the first case, the over reliance on quantitative data led to the Challenger catastrophe, but in the second, lack of adherence to the principle led to decades of unnecessary traumatic and ultimately ineffective surgeries to treat breast cancer. Moderation, it seems, is key. (*Range, The Emperor of All Maladies*)
* “Slow is efficient. Efficient is fast. Slow is fast. “, and variations — the Navy SEALS. I really like this concept, and it’s a reminder that sustainable, thoughtful progress ultimately can trump a mad dash for gratification. I need to remember that a little more.  (*Endurance, Creativity, Inc.*) 
* Discussions of Vannover Bush, the guy who designed America’s approach to scientific research (...search)  (*Loonshots, The Emperor of All Maladies*)
* The toxic green-blue algae that threatens water supplies around the Great Lakes and can almost instantaneously kill a dog (*The Death and Life of the Great Lakes, a NYT article*)
* The terrifying nature of much of scientific and especially medical research, in hindsight, and its susceptibility to our own biases and personal desires. If nothing else, a striking reminder to stay skeptical, humble, and doubtful about anything that seems obvious (*She Has Her Mother’s Laugh, How to Change Your Mind, The Emperor of All Maladies*)
* Similarly, the terrifying influence and leverage of big industries (tobacco, fossil fuels, and the like) to affect the decisions and trajectory for basically everyone on Earth (*Losing Earth, Falter, The Emperor of All Maladies*)
* On the other hand, the people that do some of these things believe just as passionately that they are somehow doing the “right” thing, regardless of how absurd it seems to me. So many high-level and impactful decisions are made by people driven by arbitrary beliefs, shaped by chance and circumstance. While I don’t think I’d make those same decisions if I today were placed in their shoes, I have to believe that if I lived their life — and had walked the metaphorical 10,000 steps in their shoes — beforehand, I probably would (*The Chief, The Hill to Die On, Losing Earth*).
* (This has nothing to do with books, but coincidental none the less.) The similarity of the behaviors and our treatment of one-year-old babies and one-year-old puppies- playing with toilet water, eating mulch, running in fields with pure joy, demanding and receiving, alternating, adoration and loving frustration.
