Greetings, friends!

Here's what I've stumbled upon lately. I've certainly  a lot, and hope you do too.

What have you discovered lately, in your real or virtual worlds?

Cheers,

Maya

- [What magnificent landscapes these are!](https://www.dominiqueteufen.com/my-travels-through-the-world) Inspired me to get out there and make some of my own… which might not require as much travel as you’d expect.
- [A computer server powered by a tomato plant](https://www.dezeen.com/2021/09/22/ilja-schamle-warm-earth-server/).  The designer behind this project didn’t take any shortcuts, and reading the details of how electricity is generated by the ecosystem is fascinating, and a little spooky (so seasonal!).
- On [the origins of “taboo,”](http://oceans.nautil.us/article/672/the-new-taboos) how the concept was integral to indigenous people’s management of natural resources, and why we need to learn how to implement it again.
- [These words don’t exist](https://www.thisworddoesnotexist.com). But you could’ve fooled me…
- Found this article on the [neuroaesthetics of mental health facilities](https://neo.life/2021/10/neuroaesthetics-mental-health-facilities-of-the-future/) particularly relevant recently. It’s interesting how the little choices can make the biggest differences.
- Very cool [visualizations of different kinds of (de)centralization](https://newpublic.org/article/1668/a-visual-guide-to-decentralization), in the context of digital public spaces.
- Orcas are my very favorite, and [this potential outer coast subpopulation](https://www.hakaimagazine.com/news/scientists-found-a-new-kind-of-killer-whale/?omhide=true&utm_source=Hakai+Magazine+Weekly&utm_campaign=f5bab0a3bf-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_09_06_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0fc1967411-f5bab0a3bf-121668550) seems especially cool.
- [Reverse logistics are important](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/free-returns-online-shopping/620169/?utm_source=morning_brew&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=rtb) and sorely overlooked. Let’s learn something.
- A writer tends to her land and [ponders the meaning of invasive species,](https://emergencemagazine.org/essay/invasives/) of her role as an “apex” invasive (AKA a human), and of the nature of wildness in our changing world.
- This reflection on [the words we use for plant-based foods](https://www.aliciakennedy.news/p/on-words?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNTM4MzMyNywicG9zdF9pZCI6NDIzMDI1NTAsIl8iOiJJUWpKNSIsImlhdCI6MTYzNDAwNTg3MCwiZXhwIjoxNjM0MDA5NDcwLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItODQzNSIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.jE1NC5PeV0PAjsMLKWQ7u0b-MGKFDDZZ-p0K45P5bLs) made me think— and mostly agree with the author, Alicia Kennedy.
- On the wild potential of [open label placebos](https://neo.life/2021/10/the-promise-of-pills-that-do-nothing/?utm_source=NEO.LIFE&utm_campaign=0af45925a3-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_10_13_05_28&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_253ae8788d-0af45925a3-88762182).
