Or that we still talk about the ‘leg’ of a triangle or ‘face’ of a polyhedron, or that ‘calculus’ comes from the Greek word for pebble, etc…. It was the Greeks who turned math into an abstract system, a special symbolic language that allows people not just to describe the concrete world but to account for its deepest patterns and laws.
