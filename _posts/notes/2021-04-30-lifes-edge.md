## Part 1: The Quickening

### The Way the Spirit Comes to the Bones

- Our brains are attuned to difference between living and nonliving things — bias towards biological patterns
    - Similar for other animals
    - Leads to “our overweening confidence that we know what it means to be alive, even when we don’t.”
- Question of what it means to be alive → significant in context of abortion policy— when does live begin?
    - Different kinds of life: a human and a human cell can both be considered alive
    - At moment of conception, fertilized egg is actually not viable— contains 69 chromosomes until a vesicle with 23 pinch off from egg (starts with 46)
    - Stupid to say that life begins at conception → would have to account for the 10-40% of pregnancies naturally lost before implanting in uterus
    - Advances in IVF, organoids, reprogramming cells also complicate the matter— more and more cells with possibility of developing independent life

    > The question of when life begins is answered according to the purposes for which we ask it. (Joshua Lederberg, 1967)

### Death is Resisted

- Ancient intuition: to be alive is to *not* be dead
- Lineage of apes developed deeper understanding of death from other primates about 30 mya; humans even more so only about 100k years back

> Life consists in the sum of the functions, by which death is resisted. (Xavier Bichat, late 1700s)

- Set of species that inhabit a gray zone of existence between life and death → can “resurrect” after long periods of dormancy (nematodes, tardigrades, flies, fungi)
    - Controlled by loss of water and dehydration; create compounds like the sugar *trehalose* that protect DNA and other molecules when dried out
- Controversy of “brain death” — how to ensure the whole brain is not functioning?

## Part 2: The Hallmarks

### Dinner (Metabolism)

- Snakes, esp pythons, have remarkable spike in metabolism after eating (45-fold!)
    - Upreg of growth pathway genes → literally grow their intestines, etc.
    - After meal, metabolism drops rapidly until next feeding

### Decisive Matter (Decision-making)

- Slime molds → exceptional “intelligence” given that they consist of only one cell
    - Can find food in maze, determine optimal path between locations (mimic US interstate system)
    - Solve the *Knapsack problem*: how to optimally combine elements with differing costs/benefits (in this case, food sources at diff distances and diff compositions, but applies to concepts like investing, transporting goods)

### Preserving Constant the Conditions of Life (Homeostasis)

- Hibernation of bats → equilibrate to new set point
    - Periodically awake when water is running low
    - Many species devestated recently by white-nose syndrome, fungus that “wakes” in colder temps and disrupts hibernation, causes bats to use their energy stores too fast

### Copy/Paste (Reproduction)

- Trees produce pigments before dropping leaves to give them a chance to move chlorophyll into winter storage, or else would have to expend a lot of energy to re-absorb nitrogen required for the molecule come spring
    - In fall, maples also produce bud scales among branches, protected from sun by anthocyanin pigment, which hold potential to grow into flowers
    - *Samaras* = wing-like structures carrying maple seeds

### Darwin’s Lung (Evolution)

- Can be used therapeutically— bacteria that infects lungs of people with CF ultimately causing tissue damage is susceptible to infection itself by a certain phage
    - In response to phage, population evolves to be more resistant → side effect of also being less inflammatory → trials on spraying this virus into lungs of Cf patients

## Part 3: A Series of Dark Questions

### The Astonishing Multiplication

> [Life is] not the matter of the body—anatomy, chemistry, the ‘mix’ of fluids—but rather their interdependence. (Georg Ernst Stahl, 1708)

### The Astonishing Multiplication

- Bizarre nature and regeneration of the hydra

### Irritability

### The Sect

- Is there something about organic molecules that makes them essentially different than others? No, proved you could make them artificially, too (first with urea)

### The Mud Was Actually Alive

- 1800s → belief that the ocean floor was covered in a primordial ooze, a “protoplasm” that had given rise to all life
- Unfortunately, eventually the gel was found to be a side effect of mixing mud with alcohol

### A Play of Water

- Life has diff features at diff scales— from biochemical level (enzymes & metabolic rxns) to individuals and populations
- All life shares some hallmarks, but none is necessary & sufficient

### The Script

- Question of the nature of life collided with quantum physics— similar themes to matter/energy of considering it a duality; ideas that life’s essence was something at the atomic or subatomic levels
    - Shrödinger’s *What is Life? →* very popular, even though mostly wrong
    - Intrigued Crick and Watson
- NASA definition: *Life is a self-sustained chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution.*

## Part 4: Return to the Borderland

### Half Life

- What about viruses? Not really able to replicate without a host
    - Still, important sources of biological diversity, and integrated with ecosystems through the virome
- RBCs: no nucleus or mitochondria → should they be considered alive?
- Amazonian mollies = fish species that cannot reproduce with its own species... are *they* alive?

### Data Needed for a Blueprint

- When considering origins of life, must remember that the planet looked very different then than it does now (eg. no oxygen)
- Stanley Miller → invented field of prebiotic chemistry with experiments in mixing inorganic compounds, stimulating with electricity, observing what, if any, organic molecules formed
- RNA as first gene molecule seemed likely— but like only RNA-based life on Earth today, would require some kind of host to survive
    - RNA → could act as enzymes and store genetic info (ribozymes) → “RNA world”
    - Requirement for some kind of lipid that could self-assemble into lipisomes → containers for chemical reactions = necessary; discovered that source could have been from meteorites
    - Playing around with single membrane/protein combinations & how this could uptake nucleus acids (*protocells*) → method of reading DNA based on size of bases and electrical current as they passed through channel (Deamer) → basis for Oxford Nanopore
    - Experiments with mixing waters from volcanic ponds with building blocks of organic molecules, subjecting to cycles of heating and cooling → see whether polymers began to form

### No Obvious Bushes

- Similar experiments of mimicking environments, exposing to electrical currents, etc. taking place to explore whether life may have formed on other planets
    - Formation of “chimneys” of sediments that can generate current (like hydrothermal vents?) → could provide source of energy for life on exoplanets too far from sun

### Four Blue Droplets

- These days, a plethora of definitions of life, and no clear consensus among scientists
    - Geneticist Edward Trifonov → analyzed structure and linguistics of the definitions → all agree that life is *self-reproduction with variation* (but still doesn’t draw a clear line)
    - Instead, define life by *family resemblances*, forming clusters of things we consider alive and not (similar to how we would define “game”, Lisa Feldman Barrett’s emotions)
    - Philosopher Carol Cleland → no point in coming up with a definition— rather, we are still working towards a theory that explains life
    - *Assembly theory:* perhaps something about complexity of organic molecules (doesn't take more than 15 steps to break apart any inorganic molecule) → flow of information
