### Introduction

- **Introspection** = paying attention to ones own thoughts and feelings; allows us to imagine, remember, reflect, problem solve, innovate, etc.
    - Seen as one of central evolutionary advances distinguishing humans
    - When we are distressed, introspection can actually lead to more harm than good: cyclic negative thoughts & emotions = **chatter**

### 1. Why We Talk to Ourselves

- *Working memory* = an essential task of the brain, and critical to the system = *phonological loop* which manages verbal information
    - Phonological loop → *inner ear*, which retains words we just heard, and *inner voice*, which allows us to repeat them to ourselves
    - Critical to verbal development, and thus also emotional development, in children
    - Internal voice = influenced by parents, culture
    - Leads to self-control, evaluates progress on goals/objectives, runs mental simulations (similar to dreams?), constructs autobiographical narratives

### 2. When Talking to Ourselves Backfires

- *Paralysis by analysis*: over-focusing attention on automatic behaviors/skills → breakdown in execution
- Neurologically, negative verbal rumination diverts resources of neurons to emotional distress from more useful executive functions
- Effect of inner voice on our social lives:
    - Tendency to *overvoice our chatter*: to talk to others about negative emotional experiences to an excess, which pushes people away → loneliness, isolation
    - Only intensified by social media: diminishes empathy, allows for less time to self-process things before sharing
    - Caught up in the cycle because sharing info about ourselves → similar dopamine response to consuming something desirable
- Emotional pain from chatter → physical implications
    - Emotional pain activates similar parts of brain as physical pain
    - Negative verbal stream → chronic stress, *transdiagnostic risk factor* for many mental illnesses
    - Chronic psychological threat leads to changes in gene expression associated with physical attack

### 3. Zooming Out

- Inner voice helps us zoom in & identify challenging situations, which is helpful— becomes problematic when we get stuck there → lose perspective
    - Activates self-referential processing, stress response
- How to use our thoughts to gain psychological distance?
    - Concept of distancing has somewhat become equated with avoidance, but doesn’t have to
    - Not the same as mindfulness, because you still want to engage with your thoughts, just from a distant perspective
- Visualizing a situation from a physically more distant POV makes you less emotional (even changes physical response), but dampens both + and - emotions
    - Gaining distance (ex. consider a situation happening to a friend rather than you) → increased *wisdom*: ability to have more perspective, reconcile opposing views, consider longer-term consequences
    - “Outsider perspective” helps overcome loss aversion, information overload
    - Creating temporal distance is also beneficial

### 4. When I Become You

- *Distanced self-talk* = referring to yourself in third person in internal dialogue → simple and powerful way to create emotional distance
    - Can more easily calm yourself down, improve performance, use wise-reasoning, prioritize morals over personal biases
    - Works within one second, and doesn’t require level of effort that other strategies do
- Works by harnessing ability to interpret sources of stress as challenges rather than threats
    - When faced with stress, we automatically consider 1) what is required from me? and 2) do I have the personal resources to cope with that?
    - If answer is no, stress becomes a threat; yes → a challenge; distanced self-talk leads people to frame this more in the latter way
    - When journaling, try using “you” or your name rather than the more immersive “I”
- Psychological comfort from *normalizing experiences* (often through use of the universal “you” to refer to *anyone*)
    - “If other people can get through this, so can I.”
    - Often how we try to learn from negative experiences

### 5. The Power and Peril of Other People

- Studies show that talking about/sharing our negative emotions doesn’t actually help— whether after tragedy or just normal life
    - Initial reaction is to fulfill *emotional needs*, engaging in “tend and befriend” response that attenuated stress response, releases oxytocin
    - Biased to give/receive empathy over practical support → *co-rumination*: re-living the negative experience, stuck in cycle of association
- To avoid rumination, need to attend to both emotional *and* cognitive needs
    - Example = NYPS hostage negotiation approach: active listening → empathy → rapport → influence → behavior change
    - Can start to identify what people to go to that provide balanced support
- Offering support when not requested can be harmful by damaging the receiver’s self-efficacy
    - *Invisible support* (that isn’t explicit) like talking about other people with similar challenges to offer perspective, can be helpful
    - Affectionate touch is also very powerful— lowers stress, anxiety

### 6. Outside In

- Exposure to green spaces and nature → many positive benefits to mental health, chronic stress
    - *Attention restoration theory* (Kaplans): nature draws *involuntary attention* through *soft fascinations*, allowing our executive functioning systems, drained by activities of *voluntary attention*, to recharge
    - Just being in nature produces positive effect, no matter the weather; even virtual nature (videos, pictures, recorded sounds) has similar impact!
    - Also proven to impact emotional health, reduce rumination vs urban environments
- Experiences of **awe**: the wonder we feel when encountering something we can’t quite understand, self-transcendent emotion allowing people to think beyond their own needs and wants → blur lines between self and surroundings (like LSD, meditation)
    - Experiences of awe → distancing effect, reduce stress, calm inner voice, provide perspective
    - People more prone to awe → more wisdom (balanced sense of strengths and weaknesses), show more humility
- *Compensatory control:* ordering arbitrary things around us → gives sense of control, efficacy → positive psychological benefits
    - Works because having sense of control depends on relies on the world around us is organized and neat enough for our actions to have predicted outcomes
    - Can simulate sense of order in the chaos of our minds by organizing and controlling parts of our surrounding environment

### 7. Mind Magic

- *Placebo* = treatment or condition with no “active” ingredient or cause/effect that can still bring about a change
    - Concept extends to things like lucky charms, special environments, healing humans
    - Why not take full advantage of this if it has real positive outcomes?
- Can be explained by the essential component of neural processing of *expectations*
    - Uses preconscious, automatic/reflexive pathways
    - Also shifts conscious thoughts— our inner voice— by providing belief, which shapes expectations
- Placebo effects strongest for psychological outcomes, but still very powerful for physical/medical ones— can act as enhancers to some medicines/tx
- How to utilize placebos without straight-up lying to people? Can get positive outcomes even when you explain what placebos are and how they work before administering!
- *Rituals* → another (cultural) tool to mitigate chatter
    - Different than habit or routine in that they are have more strict/rigid structure, infused with meaning (helps broaden perspective, foster connection)
    - Reduce chatter through several avenues: serve as distraction, provide us with sense of order and control, can cultivate awe/fulfill emotional needs
