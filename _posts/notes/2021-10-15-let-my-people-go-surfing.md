### Preface, Intro, etc.

“To know and not to do is not to know.”

### History

- Climbing, fishing, falcon ing

- Focus on speciality outdoor market, clothing and hardware
- Part of beginning of trend for more casual workplace
- Could they grow and maintain quality?
- Concern about environmental degradation, social impact
- Took on Iroquois principle of having someone represent them seventh generation— only grow as fast as could be sustained for the next hundred years

### Philosophy

- Guiding principles, can be applied in many different ways in the face of changing world
- *Product design philosophy*
    - "Make the best product" (first part of mission statement) → anchors business in real world
    - Defined objective criteria for quality
    - Is it functional? Function determines form.
    - Is it multi-functional? Make objects as versatile as possible.
    - Is it durable? Elements should wear out evenly (also keeps things from being thrown away early).
    - Is it repairable? Make it easy to wear your product as long as possible.
        - Cycle of “take, make, destroy, repeat” is killing the planet
    - Does it fit our customer? → different “size blocks” for different body types; clothing sizes are consistent and don’t change over time.
    - Is the product (and product line) as simple as possible?
    - Is it an invention or improvement?
    - Is it a global design?
    - Is it easy to care for and clean?
    - Does it have added value?
    - Is it beautiful?
    - Does it serve our core customer?
    - Does it cause any unnecessary harm?
- *Production philosophy*
    - Concurrent, versus assembly line method
    - Use leverage with producers to ensure fair trade
    - Have to be full partner with producer to ensure quality
- *Distribution philosophy*
    - Use all channels at global reach- mail-order, online, wholesale, retail
    - *Mail-order catalogue* also conveys philosophy, education = *image* piece
    - *Philosophy of architecture* = similar to that of product design (try to use existing buildings as much as possible; if building, use waste/recycled materials; make each building unique to honor local culture)
    - Develop strong partnerships with dealers as with production— try to sell 20-25% of the dealer's merchandise
- *Employer philosophy*
    - Lots of benefits, child development center, good food
- *Management philosophy*
    - Egalitarian leadership style
    - Small groups (no more than 100 people)
- *Environmental philosophy*
    - Pessimistic— but cure = **action**
    - Worn Wear
    - Prioritizing repair, even by customers
    - Work with bluesign, etc.
    - Empower employees to get involved in activism at all levels
    - Change practices internally as much as possible— recycling, etc.
    - Donate 1% of sales to non-profits (environmental, Planned Parenthood)
    - Patagonia Provisions → attempts to do good, rather than do no harm
