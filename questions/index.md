* ...when compared to crops domesticated by artifical selection?
* ...in the context of the American chestnut? The species is currently near extinction from a blight not "native" to North America. Crosses between blight-resistant Chinese chestnuts and the vulnerable American variety have been bred, but the resultant hybrids cannot be considered true American chestnuts. More recent efforts have introduced a singular wheat gene that confers resistance to the American chestnut, and the strain has thus far proven to fit identically into the ecosystem.  So, which is more natural? What about compared to things like Roundup Ready corn?
