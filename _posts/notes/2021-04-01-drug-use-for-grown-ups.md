### Prologue: Time to Grow Up

- **Purpose**
    - Present more realistic image of typical drug user as responsible professional using drugs in pusuit of happiness
    - Make the case that a benevolent govt should not forbid adults from choosing to alter their consciousness (if it doesn’t infringe on rights of others)
- **Myths and gaps in science**
    - Drug use is not the direct cause of poverty and crime
    - “Marijuana as gateway drug” theory conflates correlation and causation
    - Research shows that recreational drugs can have negative impact on mental functioning of *infrequent* users, but less clear are effects on *frequent, experienced* users
- **Flaws in government drug policy**
    - Large racial discrepancies in marijuana arrests, dealer similar rates of using across races
    - Bias towards only researching negative effects
    - Disproportionate focus on addiction in discussing drugs, despite this being a minority of effects
- **Bottom line:** most drug use scenarios cause little or no harm, and some responsible scenarios can benefit human health and functioning
    - **Caveats**: this book does not apply to those with mental illnesses, experiencing acute emotional distress, with drug addictions

### 1. The War on Us: How We Got in This Mess

- War on drugs in reality is a war on racial minorities
    - White drug problems treated as public health crisis, vs Blacks & Hispanics as crime
    - Privileged treatment of the former comes at the expense of the latter
- When addressing racism, doesn’t help to speculate on motivations, implicit bias— impossible to prove
    - Instead, keep focus on people’s *actions*
- For much of American history, much more freedom over mind-altering drugs
    - Jefferson was a big fan of opium-based drugs
    - Early 1900s, regulation began in response to racist idea that these drugs caused Black people to commit crimes

### 2. Get Out of the Closet: Stop Behaving Like Children

- Responsibility and liberty go hand in hand— government doesn’t go around telling you what to eat, because it’s our personal responsibility to make decisions on our interest
    - It is the role of govt to provide comprehensive info on composition, nutrition, valid research, etc. to help people make those decisions
    - More oversight and transparency of drug use would likely make them less harmful, bc educate users, test purity of substances
- Makes no sense that heroin, marijuana, etc. would be criminalized when alcohol (which has its own dangers, just as “extreme”) and guns are deemed “okay”

### 3. Beyond the Harm of Harm Reduction

- The term “harm reduction” skews towards only negative effects of drugs, obscuring that most people take them for pleasure-inducing reasons
    - Instead: use terms like common sense, prevention, education
- More widely available drug-safety testing (of actual substance) could prevent may overdoses
    - Fentanyls = used as medication, stronger than heroin & often used (without knowledge of user) to extend supply

### 4. Drug Addiction is Not a Brain Disease

- Much of research showing negative effects of drugs on the brain are based on flawed interpretations of imaging data (that is rarely replicable)
    - Claiming “changes” in brain structure/function due to drugs when comparing two different groups of people (not longitudinal)
    - Ignoring confounding factors of alcohol and tobacco use
    - Referencing behavioral effects without doing any cognitive or behavioral tests
- Exaggerated claims of effects of drugs → misguided policy → harmful & detrimental outcomes, intense racial discrimination (ex. crack vs cocaine)
    - Compounded bc easier to get funding if you’re looking to find negative effects

### 5. Amphetamines: Empathy, Energy, and Ecstasy

- Methamphetamine use (a common drug used to treat ADHD) punished extremely harshly in Thailand, Phillipines
- Amphetamines can enhance pleasure, openness, intimacy, energy, etc.
    - MDMA, d-amphetamine (Adderall), and methamphetamine produce similar effects (with MDMA potentially having most pleasurable outcomes), but regulated so differently
    - Important to consider role of set vs setting in user’s experience: expectations, mindset, mood, etc.

### 6. Novel Psychoactive Substances: Searching for a Pure Bliss

- Harsh drug restrictions actually lead to synthesis of new alternatives with less well-known risks, which can be more dangerous
- Synthetic cathinones = “bath salts” can have similar positive effects like amphetamines
- Synthetic cannabinoids → bind to endocannabinoid receptors like THC & produce similar effects
    - Started being banned in US in 2011, leading to cat-and-mouse game of new alternatives (usually more risky), new bans; lack of transparency about what was actually being sold

### 7. Cannabis: Sprouting the Seeds of Freedom

- Marijuana does not cause psychosis or aggression
    - Studies claiming it does conflating correlation & causation
- Used as excuse for racial discrimination →  murder and imprisonment of black people, mothers losing custody of their children
- *There are more nuanced ways of thinking about drug use than either discouraging or promoting it!*

### 8. Psychedelics: We Are One

- Becoming more “mainstream,”
- Sometimes viewed as superior to other drugs bc of spiritual/medical justification, but still laying groundwork for more widespread rights to use

### 9. Cocaine: Everybody Loves the Sunshine

- Crack is not any more addictive or harmful than powder cocaine (they’re the same drug)
- Exaggerated, false portrayals of crack in the media have ruined more lives than the drug itself
- Police killings, almost amounting to genocide, Brazil (vs crack users)

### 10. Dope Science: The Truth About Opioids

- Heroin is actually one of the safest options for an antipsychotic
- Heroin maintenance tx for people dependent on it leads to them having actually pleasant lives (offered in Switzerland, but not even a possibility in US)
- Most deaths actually caused by taking opioids with other drugs, esp sedatives, but this is never reported
