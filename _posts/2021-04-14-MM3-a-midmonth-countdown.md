In this edition of Maya’s Musings, a plethora of links to things I stumbled across in the first weeks of the month. As always, I welcome any comments, questions, recommendations, or feedback! 

### Five articles I'm glad I read

[I enjoyed the experience of *actually* reading these five, so I’ll leave my commentary to a minimum in the hopes that you may, too!]

- [What can we tell from the evolution of Han Chinese names?](https://kontinentalist.com/stories/a-cultural-history-of-han-chinese-names-for-girls-and-boys-in-china) Sleek data visualizations, clever analyses, and some fascinating conclusions on how Chinese names reflect historical and cultural context.
- [In Defense of Thinking](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/03/31/in-defense-of-thinking/?utm_source=pocket&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pockethits) (and why now, more than ever, we need to do more of it.)
- [Our Quest for Circularity](https://www.patagonia.com/stories/our-quest-for-circularity/story-96496.html): On Patagonia's mission to be a cradle-to-cradle company, designing for more than just profit, and , most importantly... "Do we need a Better Sweater® 1/4-Zip in 18 colors?"
- [Gaia, the Scientist](http://m.nautil.us/issue/99/universality/gaia-the-scientist?mc_cid=3bee428a36&mc_eid=85e07d9f8f): Hope Jahren, one of my favorites, contemplates women, science, and the way we define ourselves.
- [Against “Feel Free To Take Some Time If You Need It"](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/against-feel-free-to-take-some-time):  As always, Anne Helen Petersen’s description of the conflation between productivity and morality give just a little more clarity to the painful persistence of workism, both within and around me.

### Four images that caught my eye

- Artist [Naoki Onogawa](https://www.instagram.com/naokionogawa/?hl=en) makes tiny paper cranes, none more than a centimeter in diameter, and displays them on bonsai-esque tree forms. As a fellow crane-folder, I was intrigued by Onogawa's reflection on seeing a display of 1000 paper cranes at a school destroyed by the 2011 tsunami: “It was like witnessing the result of a desolate ritual where people channeled their unsettled feelings into these cranes. And here they exist, spirited with prayers that they would go back and forward to and from a world beyond here. I struggle to find the words to describe it, but I think that maybe the cranes that I fold now come from that place of solemn prayer.” (via [Colossal](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2021/04/naoki-onogawa-paper-cranes/?mc_cid=42294ab297&mc_eid=73a175ec89))

- Another Japanese artist, Motoi Yamamoto, crafts stunningly intricate patterns like this one out of... salt. Why salt? "I like about the process is that I only use this natural medium for a fleeting moment in my work before returning it to its place in nature. this project enables me to experience how my life in this world is a mere moment in the long, long passage of time." It's like dominos, but so much... more (via [designboom](https://www.designboom.com/art/motoi-yamamoto-interview-memories-intricate-salt-arrangements-04-07-2021/))

![](http://mayasheth.github.io/assets/map.png)

- The global deforestation footprint of the US from 2000-2015, courtesy of [a study out in Nature Ecology & Evolution](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01417-z#MOESM1) that quantifies and maps worldwide forest loss attributed to individual countries, linking deforestation patterns to international trade and global supply chains. Check out [the supplementary materials](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41559-021-01417-z/MediaObjects/41559_2021_1417_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) for maps of other countries.

- This page from William Saville-Kent‘a 1893 publication [The Great Barrier Reef of Australia: Its Products and Potentialities](https://archive.org/details/greatbarrierreef00kent/page/n14/mode/2up), the first popular science book on the underwater world. I love the artistic style of scientific illustrations from this era, and can’t help but wonder if we’d all appreciate the world around us a little more if we took the time to study it as closely as one must to create a piece like this. (via [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/05/11/william-saville-kent-great-barrier-reef-prints/?mc_cid=d241c91191&mc_eid=01af1bb07e))

### Three cool ideas to try

- Use the peel and core of your next pineapple to make [tepache, a fermented probiotic drink](https://www.wellandgood.com/tepache-fermented-mexican-drink/) originating from Pre-Columbian Mexico
- Get the same effect as blue light glasses for about 0.00001% the time and money by... holding your device [one inch further away](https://vitals.lifehacker.com/what-happens-to-your-eyes-when-you-stare-at-screens-all-1846593909?utm_source=pocket&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pockethits) from your face
- Use this [Color Problems generator](https://colorproblems.art/) to create a color analysis of your favorite photo, in the style of the artist [Emily Noyes Vanderpoel](https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/colour-analysis-charts-by-emily-noyes-vanderpoel-1902) (and send me what you come up with!)

### Two facts that made me pause

- According to a [2019 analysis of climate-change mitigation strategies](https://rare.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2018-CCNBC-Report.pdf), getting households to reduce food waste and adopt a plant-based diet would save *twice as many carbon emissions* as getting them to recycle, switch to LED lighting and hybrid vehicles, and add rooftop solar systems combined (via [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/04/rules-eating-fight-climate-change/618515/))
- Some strains of bacteria could help California crops survive frosts. We’ve apparently known for decades that frost-sensitive plants harbor microbes that can cause ice to form at above-normal temperatures (these strains are sometimes even added to snow machines at ski resorts!). Now, researchers are trying harness other naturally-occurring strains to displace the ice-inducing ones, which can prevent frosts and the resulting damage (via [Inside Climate News](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/25032021/ice-fighting-bacteria-could-help-california-crops-survive-frost/))

### One poem for the road

**"Why" — Wendell Berry**

> Why all the embarrassment  
about being happy?  
Sometimes I'm as happy  
as a sleeping dog,  
and for the same reasons,  
and for others.
