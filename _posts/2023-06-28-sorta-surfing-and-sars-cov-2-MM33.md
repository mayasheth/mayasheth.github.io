Hey friends,

It’s been a month! I checked off one of my goals for the year by sort of surfing! At least, me, a surfboard, and the ocean were in the same place at the same time… I also broke my over three year streak and acquired COVID. I’m pretty much better now, just going stir-crazy sitting at home alone for the last week.

In other news… I’ve been continuously updating my page of *[smile-inducing, gratitude-provoking, and otherwise noteworthy moments](https://mayasheth.github.io/2023/04/15/things-that-make-me-smile).* While doing so, I realized that the 2022-2023 academic year is the first I’ve fully completed since 2014. I don’t talk about it a lot, but some relevant past reflections about what made this possible are linked [here](https://mayasheth.github.io/2020/11/20/november-2020). Trying to live by my values and share more about this part of my life, because I never know what connections or difference it can make. Always happy to chat more “offline” too! 

Back to the usual: some links recs, good quotes I came across, and books I’ve read. What’s been new in your world?

Cheers,

Maya

### Quotes [brand new section!]

- “We swallow greedily any lie that flatters us, but we sip only little by little at a truth we find bitter.” — Denis Diderot, via Dense Discovery
    - Confirmation bias, perhaps, when what we believe is not the whole picture? We want things to be simpler than what they truly are.
- “Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror. Just keep going. No feeling is final.” — Rainer Maria Rilke, via Joseph Fosano’s Twitter
    - Life is hard, but it’s also wonderful. Stay for the wonder.
- “Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don’t give up.”  — Annie Lamott in ************Bird by Bird************, via Dense Discovery

### Books
