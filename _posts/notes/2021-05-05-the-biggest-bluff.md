### Ante Up

- Goal = get into the world of poker for a year to better understand the line between *skill* and *luck*, what one can and cannot *control*, and how perceptions of control affect our *decision-making* in the face of *uncertainty*
    - In experiments on investing strategy, illusion of control or skill → people are less likely to learn from environment → make poorer decisions
    - Luck vs skill is inherently probabilistic, and our brains are not good at understanding this → prioritize anecdote and instinct over data = **description-experience gap**
    - Experience = powerful tool to help id learn to understand probabilistic scenarios, when structured as *systematic learning process*— like poker

    > Consider the 7.5 billion people who currently make up the world’s population and you can be sure that the highly improbable is happening with regular frequency. The “one chance in a million” takes place every second.

- Poker “stands at the fulcrum that balances two oppositional forces in our lives— chance and control” → ideal experiential scenario to understand strategy & decision-making
    - **No Limit Texas Hold’em** → precise amt of common vs private info; no limit on bets
        - Public info = first three cards (*flop*), fourth (*turn*), and fifth (*river*); private = your own two cards
        - No limit mimics the stakes and emotional element of real life
- Starting from scratch, how far can psychology, qualitative reasoning take you when facing mathematics, statistics, algorithms?

### The Birth of a Gambler

- Unlike in games of perfect info (like Go, chess), in poker you can win the the worst hand and lose with the best hand → *skill* plays a big role
    - Actual best hand is rarely the winner
- Kant → betting on uncertainty is one of the best ways to understand it— keeps us from conflating 90% and 100%, invokes personal accountability
- Poker teaches you to calibrate the strength of your beliefs, and to be comfortable with never having

### The Art of Losing

- Biggest key to success is objectivity
    - Kipling → “If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster // And treat those two imposters just the same...”
    - Winning early makes us think we’re much more skilled than is possible (that we can predict a coin toss, say)
- *Less certainty, more inquiry*

### The Mind of a Strategist

- Value of *position*— being able to bet after everyone else
- Pressure of time → people often make (bad) decisions based on instinct
- To truly learn from strategic experiences, need to *have a reason for every decision you make*— otherwise you never know whether skill or luck are behind the outcome
- Poker as war, or jazz (more positive-sum) → must constantly be re-evaluating depending on actions of others
- Have to learn to “pick your spots”— if you only bet when you have the best hand, people will notice and you won’t ever win big → have to learn when to be aggressive to maximize long term profits

### A Man’s World

- False sense of security in passivity, but you’re still losing money
    - But for women, this results from being socialized to be passive, to not negotiate or ask for more
- Gambler’s fallacy → faulty idea that probability has a memory
- When you’re a beginner, you think about everything, and when you’re very skillful, you do too... the period of proficiency is most dangerous → act on instincts not yet backed by experience

### No Bad Beats

- Casinos basically designed for the opposite of creative or emotional well-being— deplete decision-making abilities and emotional reserves (no nature)
- Can’t get fooled by lucky streaks... “True skill is knowing your own limits—and the power of variance in the immediate future.”
- Power of language in dictating our mental habits— dwelling on bad luck → fail to see opportunities to work past it
    - Focus more on your *decision* than the outcome

### Texting Your Way Out of Millions

- Fallacy: overconfidence in your opinion from thinking you know more than you do just because you have more information
- *Attention* = powerful motivator of overconfidence, forcing you to constantly reevaluate → can maximize *skill* edge, minimize how much you leave to chance

### A Storytelling Business

> Never do anything, no matter how small it might seem, without asking why, precisely, you’re doing it. And never judge anything others do without asking the same question.

- Does you no good to just get mad at someone for making a decision you wouldn’t— can learn so much more if you **don’t forget the why.**

### The Gambler and the Nerd

- Lodden Thinks: two people bet on what a third person answers to some question (anything from “How old is Clint Eastwood?” to “How much would someone have to pay you to never wear socks again?”)
    - All about reading the person, not the true answer
    - Played Price is Right style

### The Art of the Tell

- Our brains are prediction-making machines
- Initial, fleeting perceptions of people = *thin-slice judgements* → usually based on inputs like facial structure, expressions, our own experience
    - Intuitive & based on large samples → break down at individual level
    - Consensus about what a trait signals doesn’t mean it’s true— ex. most popular teachers are usually not the most competent
    - Judgements on certain traits influence our perception of others, and we often are unaware of this (ex. we find a more likeable person more attractive, but cite attractiveness as why we find them more likeable)
- Is there a scientifically-based approach to judging when people are lying, or forming more accurate perceptions of them?
    - If we pay attention to the right things, our intuition actually does pretty well at predicting behavior (hand motions → whether or not someone is bluffing, but not judgements about them overall)

### Reading Myself

- *Tells* = repeatable patterns and behaviors, not one specific gesture; generally don’t involve facial expressions (easy to mask)... studies found two main patterns:
    - Thought process/approach to game → how you handle your chips
    - Concealment: how players choose to actively hide what they think are telling behaviors
- **Cognitive-affective personality system (CAPS)** = proposed by Mischel; alternative to personality trait tests like the Big Five
    - Very context dependent— can be thought of as “if-thens”

    > People aren’t a combination of traits. They are a mosaic of reactions to and interactions with situations.

    - Accounts for dynamic nature of how people’s tells can change over the course of a tournament

### Full Tilt

- *Irrational perseverance* → when faced with a choice, we give up rationality instead of the enterprise
    - Leads to *planning fallacy*— tendency to be overly optimistic about timelines & goals
    - Which then leads to *sunken cost fallacy*— keeping to course of action just because of resources you’ve already invested
- Knowing about a fallacy or bias doesn’t make the intuition less attractive!
    - We actively avoid to get more information about a choice once we’ve made an intuitive decision so that we won’t feel like we have to change our minds
- In poker, *tilt* = making decisions based on emotion
    - Ultimate goal is not to stop experiencing emotions, but to identify and abs luxe them, evaluate whether they contain useful info to our decision-making

### The Ludic Fallacy

> Chance is just chance: it is neither good nor bad nor personal. Without us to supply meaning, it's simple noise.

- Only things we can control are our actions, thinking, reactions, decision processes... *cannot* control body, property, reputation, command... (Epictetus)
