The fundamental principles that I want to drive my decision-making. Trying to be transparent about what I care about-- to make myself think about it, as a reminder, for accountability, and... because I can be.

## Connection
LOVE  // FAMILY  // FRIENDS // ECOLOGY // GRATITUDE // FLEXIBILITY

Have the mental energy and flexibility to cultivate close relationships // Give and receive love freely

**Practice this now:** Text people back // Write letters and send mail // 5+ gratitudes a day // Ask for critical and honest // feedback  Practice “attempathy”

**So I can do this later:**  Be a role model and mentor for Sophie, Anya, and Bela // Live carbon neutral // Visit NYC and go to fancy places // Get another puppy

*2021 intentions:* (1) Keep up with letter writing.

- (1) Did this, with Erin and Sabrina and Grandma

*2022 intentions:* Reach out to friends or family at least once a week to talk. // Keep up with gratitudes. // Give gifts often. // Continue sending Maya’s Musings. // Care for Laguna and my plant babies.

## Authenticity
CONGRUENCE // HONESTY // GROWTH  // COURAGE // INDEPENDENCE

Articulate my perspective // Stand by my values // Have the courage to be flexible // Say what I believe and do what I say

**Practice this now:** Anticipate 1-, 5-, and 10- year consequences of my actions // Do something once and not the next day 

**So I can do this later:** Live with choice in line with my values // Make decisions with intentionality and conscientiousness //  Maintain legal independence 

*2021 intentions:* (1) Don't keep reading books I hate. // (2) Keep finding a quote of the day. // (3) Formulate opinions on the topics I read about. // (4) Journal three pages a day. // (5) Breathing. Do it often.

- (1) Still need to work on this. Read/listened to a lot of things I really didn’t like. // (2) Stopped every day, but still record good ones if I come across them. That’s okay, too. // (3) Somewhat do this through my newsletter. // (4) Definitely didn’t do this. Should increase journalling efforts. // (5) Got out of the habit, but trying to reintegrate at least once a day.

*2022 intentions:* (1) Don’t read books I hate! // (2) Identify the driving forces of my habits & routines. // (3) Journal one page a day (gotta start somewhere) // (4) Keep sending Maya’s Musings, with increasing commentary! // (5) Breathe, stretch, or yoga once a day.

## Challenge
PERSEVERANCE // PURPOSE // MASTERY // ACHIEVEMENT // RESPONSIBILITY

Make an impact on the world // Push the limits of what I can do // Have a purpose & embrace responsibility 

[“Do more.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwYy4scOJi8)

**Practice this now:** 1+ min ice cold showers // Read 2+ research articles a week   

**So I can do this later:** Train for a marathon, triathlon, big hike // Dive deep into research 

*2021 intentions:* (1) Either read an article, save it, or skip it— don’t just scroll through.

- Sometimes did this, but still a work in progress.

*2022 intentions*: (1) Read an article or skip it— don’t just scroll through. // (2) Learn something or work on research every day. // (3) Move my body in some way that fits what it feels.

## Adventure
CREATIVITY // CURIOSITY // EXPLORATION

“To travel is to explore without a hypothesis.” 

Be a life-long learner // Keep on with scientific discovery // Pursue my interests, no matter how random // Actively seek wonder // Explore my physical, intellectual, and creative worlds // Be still to do artful things 

**Practice this now:** Draw once in awhile // Go outside every day // Keep reading 

**So I can do this later:** Go to Patagonia // Surf camp in Costa Rica

*2021 intentions:*  (1) Create something every day. // (2) Run outside when I can.

- (1) Did this, for the most part. // (2) Did not do this. Will start when possible.

*2022 intentions:* (1) Continue creating something every day. // (2) Read a poem or book each day. // (3) Go outside and be observant when doing so.
