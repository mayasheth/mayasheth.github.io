Greetings, friends!

I have quite a collection for y’all today, and lots of pretty things included. Hope some of these clicks make your day a little more beautiful, and happy Valentine’s day and happy Monday to all!

Cheers,

Maya

### The _Aesthetic_ Collection

- A living catalogue keeping track of the rainbow of [colors that dyes made from mushrooms can create](https://www.mushroomcoloratlas.com/)— nature is beautiful, and awesome in the literal meaning of the word.
- An article featuring [beautiful Australian aboriginal art](https://www.ft.com/content/cbacd9ac-68e2-4212-9579-ad1ab59813ab)— reminds me of a book I read awhile back, [*Sand Talk*](https://mayasheth.github.io/2021/06/24/sand-talk), that discussed indigenous ways of thinking.
- [Plen air paintings by Jeremy Sans photographed in situ](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2022/01/jeremy-sams-plein-air/). Very meta (*not* Facebook, just... self-referential), and very cool.
- Stunning photographs of [sea salt production](https://www.tomhegen.com/collections/the-salt-series-iii)…
- … of [Madagascar’s last baobab trees](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2022/02/beth-moon-baobab/)…
- … of [dogs with the most aptly-designed cones](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2019/02/cone-of-shame-winnie-au/)…
- … of [dogs, sled racing](https://hakaimagazine.com/videos-visuals/one-great-shot-mush-speed/?utm_source=Hakai+Magazine+Weekly&utm_campaign=c7d4022428-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_09_06_COPY_03&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0fc1967411-c7d4022428-121668550)…
- … of [the minerals that actually result](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2022/02/dillon-marsh-cgi-mines/) from the oft-horrendously destructive processes of mining…
- … and of [outer space, in all its glory](https://mymodernmet.com/save-a-star-astro2021-awards/).

### The Rest

- We hear a lot about the possibilities of COVID becoming endemic these days… I didn’t really know what that meant, and [this article explains why none of us actually do](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/02/endemicity-means-nothing/621423/).
- [Dining in an igloo restaurant](https://www.spoon-tamago.com/2022/02/01/igloo-restaurant-nagano/?mc_cid=1e7a3d03c2&mc_eid=9657ac99e9) is on my bucket list.
- I rode horses for a few years back in the day, and [this essay on the neurobiological miracle of the horse-human connection](https://aeon.co/essays/horse-human-cooperation-is-a-neurobiological-miracle) made me very nostalgic.
- I feel like my cryptic crossword obsession is slowly crafting my brain into the sort of state described by the Scrabble-loved author here, where he [begins to see anagrams everywhere he looks](https://lithub.com/on-the-insanity-of-being-a-scrabble-enthusiast/). I have to say, it makes the world a much more interesting and interactive place sometimes.
- An interesting snapshot of actual “de-extinction” projects, focusing on [efforts to bring back the aurochs to Europe](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/aurochs-rewilding?utm_source=Gastro+Obscura+Weekly+E-mail&utm_campaign=1c167a60e9-GASTRO_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_02_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_2418498528-1c167a60e9-75453502&mc_cid=1c167a60e9&mc_eid=b32ef50eb4).
- Wonder where the clothes you return or donate actually end up? [These investigators tried to find out](https://gijn.org/2021/09/21/tracking-clothes/), and the results aren’t as pleasant as you may wish.
- [Meet the dogs that save people buried by avalanches](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2022/01/19/avalanche-dogs-ski-jackson-hole/). Yet another reason that pups are the best.
