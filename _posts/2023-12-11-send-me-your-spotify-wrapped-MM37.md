Hey friends,

Happy December— how wild is it that 2024 is less than three weeks away? I don’t have many updates on life happenings since the last time we chatted, so I’ll keep this quick.

Here are a some things I’m treasuring over the holiday season:

  - Michael Buble’s Christmas album
  - The smell of fresh pine wreaths
  - Fairy lights
  - Choosing, making, wrapping, and giving gifts
  - The “Best of 2023” lists in every domain
  - Reindeer, polar bears, and Hallmark movies

What are a few of your favorite things?

Wishing you a (figuratively) warm winter and refreshing new year,

Maya

There is no outside where we could take this thing to. There is no little pocket situated outside of life” to which you could take “life’s provisions and squirrel them away.” Spending your days trying to get experiences “under your belt”, in an effort to maximise your collection of experiences, or to feel more confident about the future supply of similar experiences, means placing yourself in a position from which you can never enjoy them fully, because there’s a different agenda at play.” This hit me hard.

### Things I’m trying and loving

- [HowWeFeel](https://howwefeel.org/) — always a fan of a self-study, and it’s interesting to track the energy and valency of my mental state across the days! Really clean and intuitive design, simple analytics, all for free!
- [one sec](https://one-sec.app/)  — introducing a delay to opening apps I often instinctively open and scroll on… according to their algorithm, I’ve cut the number of times I open these apps in half!
- Cold brew coffee — got a cold brew maker for my birthday, so I can make 8 cups of concentrate at a time. Cold brew results in coffee that is less acidic, more caffeinated, and smoother-tasting coffee than other methods. I’ve enjoyed being able to choose and enjoy actual coffee varieties (recently, from Verve and Sightglass) versus just Nespresso pods!

### Quotes

- “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.” — Oscar Wilde
- “First we have to believe, and then we believe.” — German physicist G.C. Lichtenberg (fake it till ya make it?)
- From the same: “I have remarked very clearly that I am often of one opinion when I am lying down and of another when I am standing up.” Reminds me of all those things you know will make you feel good that you never want to do beforehand…

### Books

- *Cobalt Red* — Siddharth Kara
    - [How the Blood of the Congo Powers Our Lives]
    - Democratic Republic of the Congo book. Did I learn something? Yes, for sure— I had never thought about cobalt (its uses, impact of mining) or the political history of the Congo beyond King Leopold. Definitely added a layer of complexity to my view of geopolitical relations (China controls most of the mines?) and unintended consequences of electrification.
    - “Artisanal”(which sounds fancy but just means small-scale) mining of cobalt is intrinsically tied to electrification and the absolutely horrendous conditions in the Congo
    - Cobalt is an essential component of lithium rechargeable batteries— increased demand with smartphones, but especially with EVs! Cobalt increases energy density and stability of batteries.
    - A SLEW of negative health consequences in adults and children from heavy metal exposure, environmental contamination
    - Who is responsible for abuses in the artisanal mining sector? Mining companies themselves (many Chinese), or tech companies?

- *The Copenhagen Trilogy* — Tove Ditlevsen, transl. by Tiina Nunnally and Michael Favala Goldman
    - [Childhood — Youth — Dependency]
    - Denmark book. Did I learn anything? Not really, although it was novel to experience WWII from the perspective of a Danish child.
    - A mid-century autobiographical coming-of-age story of a Danish creative writer, told with an almost cringe-worthy degree of honesty and emotional transparency. Honestly, I thought this was really boring, and I had no feelings but annoyance towards the narrator.
