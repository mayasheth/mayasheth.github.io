Hi friends!

This is a little later in the month than usual, but I'll blame it on daylight savings and the wild weather for distracting me from my musings. Below, an amalgam of links that caught my interest that I thought might catch yours, too-- I'd say it's a good mix of fun and informative.

Find any of these interesting? What have you been reading lately? Always open to chat!

Cheers,

Maya

- [ProPublica’s map of cancer-causing air pollution](https://projects.propublica.org/toxmap/) from industrial sources is essential and disillusioning. Now, what can we do about it?
- [Patagonia now sells wine](https://www.patagoniaprovisions.com/pages/sourcing-natural-wine) (and sake, and cider). Apparently, it’s good.
- Race is not a biological construct— and systems based on the contrary profoundly affect people’s lives: [Here, a woman learns she could have gotten a kidney transplant two years earlier](https://www.statnews.com/2021/11/01/kidney-disease-ancestry-dot-com-transplant/) if she’d gotten her genetic testing done sooner.
- Artist [Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg](https://daisyginsberg.com) designs to please the pollinators, not humans. The [process, results and interactive components](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/nov/03/art-for-bees-mad-looking-installation-suits-pollinators-tastes) of her work are awesome.
- Very clever analysis by FiveThirtyEight on [how we interpret soccer when we can’t see who’s playing](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/soccer-looks-different-when-you-cant-see-whos-playing/). Implicit bias hides from nothing!
- Some awesome (in the true sense of the word) art highlighting the effects of [coral bleaching](https://thisiscolossal.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d6c1d1d7c7f055e30321f9a6a&id=d1d3fc7824&e=73a175ec89) and [polar ice melt.](https://thisiscolossal.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d6c1d1d7c7f055e30321f9a6a&id=0bb4af0cb3&e=73a175ec89)
- In honor of my trip to the city, check out Eric Kogan’s photographs of [serendipitous moments in NYC](https://www.erickogan.com/).
- I thoroughly enjoyed scrolling through [Maria Popova’s thoughts on the late Bruno Munari’s illustrated book, *Drawing a Tree*,](https://themarginalian.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=13eb080d8a315477042e0d5b1&id=dfdd7ad9dc&e=01af1bb07e) and hope you do, too.
- Interesting analysis of [the promise and perils of off-shore wind](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/11/floating-wind-farms-california-marine-life/620489/?utm_source=Hakai+Magazine+Weekly&utm_campaign=84884db5ab-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_09_06_COPY_03&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0fc1967411-84884db5ab-121668550), through a series of profiles of players in California
- One of the coolest data analysts, Giorgia Lupi, [stitched an epic journal of her entire life](https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/pentagram-giorgia-lupi-moleskine-art-101121?utm_source=weeklyemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=intemail).
- [A fun word game](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), limited to once a day— it’s like that one code-cracking game with the colors, except with letters.
