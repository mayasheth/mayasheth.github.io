### Intro

- We don’t like to change our minds!
    - Once we accept a story, we do t question it
    - Rely on habits, assumptions, instincts
    - Act of reconsidering, building mental flexibility → valuable
- In this book... 1) how to open our own minds, 2) how to encourage others to think again, 3) how to create communities of lifelong learners

## Part I: Individual Rethinking

- Mindsets we take wrt our perspectives:
    - *Preacher* → when our sacred beliefs are in jeopardy, deliver “sermons” to protect & promote ideaks
    - *Prosecutor* → when we recognize flaws in others’ reasoning, marshal arguments to prove them wrong
    - *Politician* → when seeking to win over an audience, campaign for approval of constituents
    - These all prevent us from thinking in the mode of a *scientist*, undertaking more systematic analysis & experimentation
- The smarter you are, the worse you fail at analyzing patterns that contradict your views
    - Confirmation bias, desirability bias, the “I’m not biased” bias (guilty...)
- Thinking like a scientist requires being *actively* open-minded rather than reactive: hypothesis-*generating*/data-driven, not hypothesis-confirming
    - Only common trait among successful and creative artists, scientists, politicians, etc. = *cognitive flexibility, intellectual curiosity, openness*
    - Rethinking cycle: **intellectual humility → doubt → curiosity → discovery →**
- How to find the sweet spot of confidence between being an armchair quarterback and an imposter?
    - *Dunning-Kruger effect:* competence and confidence are inversely related (except when you know literally nothing about a topic, confidence is usually low)

    > Arrogance is ignorance plus conviction. While humility is a permeable filter that absorbs life experience and converts it into knowledge and wisdom, arrogance is a rubber shield that life experience simply bounces off of.  — Tim Urban

    - **Humility** from Latin roots meaning *from the earth*— about being grounded, recognizing that we are flawed and fallible → goal is **confident humility**
    - Usually better to err on the side of doubt: possible benefits of imposter syndrome → motivation to work harder and to work smarter, to continually seek knowledge/learning
- How can we find joy in being wrong?
    - Murray Davis → ideas survive bc they’re interesting, bc they challenge weakly held opinions, induce us to be curious and open up. *But*, when a core belief is questioned, totalitarian ego is activated → we shut down (“protector” parts?)
    - (His descriptions of students having their personal worldview annihilated and finding it fun reminds me of the exhilaration I feel after a hard interview or test, or even learning a completely new, better way to think about a topic or problem in working on)
    - **Detachment** is key: 1) detaching your present from past, and 2) detaching your opinions from your identity
        - Base your identity on *values* instead of opinions
    - Difference between good and great forecasters is how often they update their predictions (just a small shift, from 2 to 4 *rethinking cycles*!)
    - Counter confirmation bias by actively looking for evidence that proves you wrong
- Working in teams:
    - Low *relationship conflict* (personal/emotional issues) & moderate *task conflict* (re: ideas & opinions) → optimal performance
    - We want to work with people with dissimilar traits and backgrounds, but similar principles and values (diversity of ideas for shared commitment)
    - Important to work with “disagreeable” people (a *challenge network*) go activate rethinking, but be careful not to let task conflict spill over into relationship conflict
    - Frame disputes as *debates* rather than disagreements
    - Most effective to focus on *how* your idea will work than argue over *why*— also reveals limits of understanding

## Interpersonal Rethinking: Opening Other People’s Minds

- How can we convince other people to rethink their ideas?
    - More skilled negotiators 1) identify areas of agreement/common ground, 2) ask (curious) questions (allows insights to come from the other person themselves), 3) don’t get into offensive/defensive spirals, 4) offer fewer reasons (stick with a few strong ones), 5) comment in their feelings & test their understanding of other side’s feelings
    - Most effective to communicate your POV with moderate level of confidence
- Why do people form stereotypes about rival groups, and what does it take to get them to rethink them?
    - Identifying with a group satisfies needs for *belonging* and *status*
    - Hard to shift stereotypes bc tendencies of *group polarization*, *conformity*
    - Emphasizing common humanity, building empathy with individual from other group not enough to overcome group stereotypes...
    - What can work? Contemplating the *arbitrariness of one’s animosity*, engaging in **counterfactual thinking**: explore origins of your own beliefs, reflect on how diff circumstances (eg. of birth) → diff beliefs; intergroup contact (the power of conversation)
- **Motivation interviewing** to get people to change their minds (alt. to persuading, which can make their beliefs stronger)
    - Goal = be a *guide* to help someone find their own motivation to change through 1) asking open-ended questions, 2) engaging in reflective listening, 3) affirming the person’s desire & ability to change, 4) summarizing to check for understanding
    - Be curious about the other person’s beliefs, make sure it’s clear the decision is up to them
    - Instead of commanding or recommending, say something like, “Here are some things that have helped me— do you think any of them might work for you?”
    - Listen for a shift from *sustain talk* (commentary about status quo) to *change talk* (about desire, need, ability to adjust) and steer convo from there
    - Important to not use this manipulatively— backfires when attempts to influence are detected!
    - Power of listening (of having *inverse charisma*) → display of respect and care, offers our most scarce and precious gift: attention

## Part III: Collective Rethinking

- **Binary bias**: human tendency to simplify complex continuums into two categories → polarization problem, why just knowing there’s an alternative opinion doesn’t help people find common ground
    - Antidote = complexifying by showcasing a range of perspectives

    > ...it takes a multitude of views to help people realize that they too contain multitudes.

    > When conflict is cliché, complexity is breaking news. — Amanda Ripley

    - Ex. Wide range of beliefs exist about climate change, not just activists vs deniers; important to distinguish the latter from skeptics, who do update their thinking as they get new information
    - Including caveats and contingencies also conveys complexity
    - Talk about *when* a certain claim is true rather than *whether* it is true
    - Perspective-taking isn’t actually that effective in polarized discussions, bc we can actually read minds... instead, try *perspective-seeking* (talk to people!)
    - Binary bias also applies to emotion → allowing mixed emotions can help you understand complex situations & relationships
- How can the way we teach foster the skill of rethinking?
    - Teaching kids (& others) to be better fact-checkers by 1) interrogating info instead of just consuming it, 2) rejecting rank and popularity as proxies for reliability, 3) understanding that sender of info may not be its source
    - Lecturing → sometimes preferred by students over more **active learning methods**, but proven to be less effective; doesn’t allow student to learn to think or question by themselves
    - Embrace **confusion** when faced with complex problems (and don’t try to rescue others immediately from the feeling) → responding to confusion with curiosity & interest = hallmark of an open mind
    - Engage in critique of your own and others’ *work* (not the person)
- Rethinking as a **collective capability,** dependent on an organization’s culture
    - **Psychological safety** (trusting your peers, being able to admit to mistakes, okay with taking risks,  etc.) → foundation of *learning cultures* (vs performance cultures)
    - People in power showing vulnerability → fosters open communication, two-way feedback
    - **Process accountability** → always explaining why you’re doing something a certain way, not relying on best practices jusy because → actually builds psych safety; builds challenge network
    - Separation of decision makers and decision evaluators = important for unbiased data

### Conclusion

- Too much grit → can get locked into our beliefs or plans (ex. for our career) → identity **foreclosure**
- Important to continually reevaluate relationships, too— what your expectations are of each other
