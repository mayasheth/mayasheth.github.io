### Introduction

- **Motivation Code** = "**unique, constant, unchanging** behavioral drive that orients a person to achieve a distinct pattern of results"
    - Comprises three motivational drivers from a set of 27
    - Motivation is *not* about diligence/laziness, just enjoying things, something that comes naturally with the "perfect job"
    - Understanding our own motivations better → can produce better work to be more productive, have better relationships
- **My top three:** Make an Impact, Explore, Be Central
- **Mom's:** Experience the Ideal, Influence Behavior, Be Unique
