## 1. _climate change is violence._
* From Rebecca Solnit's _Encyclopedia of Trouble and Spaciousness_:
  > "That's a tired phrase, the destruction of the Earth, but translate it into the face of a starving child and a barren field- and then multiply that a few million times. Or just picture the tiny bivalves: scallops, oysters, Arctic sea snails, that can't form sells in acidifying oceans right now. Or another superstorm tearing apart another city. Climate change is global-scale violence against places and species, as well as against human beings. Once we call it by name, we can start having a real conversation about our priorities and values. Because the revolt against brutality begins with a revolt against the language that hides brutality." 

## 2. _plants behave ethically._
* From Peter Wohlleben's _The Hidden Life of Trees_, Richard Powers' _Overstory_, [various](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep08495) [other](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6283/342) [articles](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03069.x):
* Facilitated by extensive [mycorrhizal networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal_network), sometimes referred to as the wood wide web, trees have been shown to exchange and divert nutrients to struggling community members. This behavior appears to meet the definition of "ethical" as to conforming to an accepted standard of conduct

## 3. _reality is interaction._
* From Carlo Rovelli's _Reality Is Not What It Seems_... If physically, fundamental particles can only be observed via their interactions with other particles, why should the concept not apply at the macro-scale? Are we humans really individuals, or a manifestation of a "distributed ecosystem"?
* Alternatively, from the point of view of Miguel Nicolelis in _The True Creator of Everything_, reality arises from the interaction of our brains with sensory world. For example, as he quotes Marcelo Gleiser in _The Island of Knowledge_, "Mass and charge do not exist, per se: they only exist as a part of a narrative we humans construct to describe the natural world."
