### Poetry and the Moon

- “…stars were the first *text*, the first instance of gabbiness; connecting the stars, making a pattern out of then, was the first *story*, sacred to storytellers. But the moon was the *poem*, in the lyric sense, an entity complete in itself…”

### On Secrets

- Hearing is the first sense we gain (and the last we lose) → the experience of unborn babies being is the experience of sound with no context… “that the world is a secret.”

> The idea of a secret that will be revealed always results in one of two scenarios: death and destruction, or self-discovery and recovery beyond our wildest dreams of unification. And in the greatest of sagas, both at the same time.

> Was spring a secret that winter carried? Of course it was. Spring now carries the secret of winter.

### On Fear

- “The memory of pain is a pain unto itself, and thus feeds our fear like a foyer with mirrors on both sides.” (poet Tony Hoagland) → imaginary pain, psychological torture can be more effective than physical

### Madness, Rack, and Honey

- *Metaphor* = event = an exchange of energy between two things, helps a poem become a physical experience
    - Recalls Buddhist thought of continual cycles of existence and nonexistence…
- Russ Rymer in The New Yorker, quoting philologist Heymann Steinthal: “Language is self-awareness. That is, understanding oneself… as one is understood by another. One understands oneself: that is the beginning of language.”
- The paradox that the creative process requires a lot of wasted time— but you can’t *use* wasted time, it just has to be wasted…

> It takes a lot of time to be a genius, you have to sit around so much doing nothing, really doing nothing. (Gertrude Stein)

> Runaway thought, I wanted to write it; instead, I write that it has run away. (Pascal)

- “In other words, your poems speak out of your wasted time the way your life speaks out of the wasted time of your nonlife, the time that surrounds your life span.”

### Someone Reading a Book

- “Am I a superfluous person because I have read more than I can possibly process, like an intake of food the body doesn’t need, or am I a superfluous person because I have gone out and bought myself a new calculator?”
- “In our marginal existence, what else is there but this voice within us, this great weirdness we are always leaning forward to listen to?”

### Short Lecture on Prayer

- Poetry happens when we raise our voices (singers, storytellers, priests) *and* when we lower them (secret tellers, lovers, password keepers):

> Cries and whispers. A bang or a whimper. Whatever the case, if we want to be heard, we must raise our voice, or lower it.

### Et cetera

> When your pencil is dull, sharpen it. And when your pencil is sharp, use it until it is dull again.

- The first known act of translation? When a mother heard her baby cry, and had to decide in an instant what it meant. Q
