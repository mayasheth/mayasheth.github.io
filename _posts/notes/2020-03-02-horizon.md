### Introduction
* _Past that lies a horizon of water. A blank page._
* _He understands that this foaming storm surf has arrived on the beach from someplace else._
* One motivation to write the book was _to create a narrative that would engage a reader intent on discovering a trajectory in her or his own life, a coherent and meaningful story, at a ting in our cultural and biological history when it has become an attractive option to lose faith in the meaning of our lives._
* _...the protean and stage-like expanse of that sea..._
* _...opposite the arc of the moon’s course, an immeasurable, glittering field of undimmed stars._
* _We are the darkness, as we are, too, the light._
* _...the failure to live of to be loved explains the burden of mental pain people endure._
* _...and wind to choreograph the movements of the clouds.._
* Quoting Don Walsh, descender of the Mariana Trench: “To explore is to travel without a hypothesis.” Surprise, appreciation of the unknown _informs you emphatically that the way you imagined the world is not the way it is._

### Cape Foulweather, Coast of Oregon, Eastern Shore of the North Pacific Ocean, Western North America
* _...chiaroscuro faces of the inland mountains... filamentous networks of roads..._
* The idea that our society needs people _both indigenously rooted and internationally aware_
* Cites John Luther Adam’s Pulitzer Prize-winning _Become Ocean_ as an example of music’s _remarkable capacity to revitalise one’s expectations_... I concur. 

### Skraeling Island, Mouth of Alexandra Fjord, East Coast of Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada
* _...the percolation of meltwater from the glacier’s cold lip..._, described as:
	* _a cascading stream of water only a few inches deep, turquoise against the white ice, a white so intense I can’t continue looking at it._
	* _...the ribbon of water seems almost to turn over on itself, like a Möbius strip._
	* _...a maze of rivulets..._
* Navajo idea of beauty: _a high level of coherence existing everlastingly in the world,_ renewed by _integrating ourselves with a world over which we have no control._ 
* When a boundary becomes a horizon, _[t]he unknown future calls out to the present and to the remembered past, and in that moment of expansion, the imagined future seems attainable._

### Puerto Ayora, Isla Santa Cruz, Archipiélago de Colón, Eastern Equatorial Pacific
* _...the geography that preoccupies Hawking, the depthless black with its pulsing crystal dots._
* _...the dark ocean, which sighs now and then in lazy susurrations against the rocks..._
* _the arrangement of space here and the scheme of simple colors—the broad turquoise lagoon, the deep blue of a high-pressure sky, the long pink line of distant flamingos in front of a wall of green mangrove trees—_
* Of the Galapagos coasts... _In every corner of the world there was such resplendent life, unexpected, integrated, anonymous._
* Quoting Australian philosopher Val Plumwood: _...humanity’s task now is to “resituate non-humans in the ethical and to resituate humans in the ecological._

### Jackal Camp, Turkwel River Basin, Western Lake Turkana Uplands, Eastern Equatorial Africa
* Dr. Misia Landau -> much scientific and popular writing by paleo anthropologists is grounded more on a “deep narrative structure” — casting all humanity’s ancestors as evolutionary dead-ends along the path to the ideal of man — than the true ambiguity and objectivity of fossil records. 
* The bird’s outermost tail feathers, like streamers, _trace the bird’s passage through the air like Japanese calligraphy brushes._

### Port Arthur, State of Tasmania, Northern Shore of the Southern Ocean, Southeastern Australia —> Botany Bay, State is New South Wales, Western Shore of the South Pacific 
*  On exploring the rivers at the bottom of gorges: _...the brightness of [the sun’s] incident light ricocheting off walls of two-billion-year-old rock, walls in every shade of purple one might catalog, from damson to heliotrope, from hyacinth to raisin, each purple changing hue as the hours passed and as the sun’s reflected rays became direct, creating a harsher light._
* Merely stepping into some realms — Alexandra Fjord lowland, Roca Redonda, Victoria Falls in the moonlight, the Great Barrier Reef reminds one that _no matter how steep the spiral of despair might become, beauty without design, without restraint was all around_, reminds one _of the possibilities, of the things you too rarely thought of._
* What a scene: after a storm passes, _the sun broke through the trailing clouds_, a double rainbow seeming to _span a dozen miles of the desert_, and at the same moment, _more than a hundred kangaroos bounding north and west across the plain_... _The sight of it was so exhilarating the three of us in the cab nodded an affirmation to one another. Whatever was wild and lyrical in the timeless world, we were in the middle of it now. For some reason we all felt compelled to shake hands._
* The mala: a small marsupial- a ‘rufous hare-wallaby,’ AKA spinifex rat, AKA _Lagorchestes hirsitus_. Experienced population collapse both because of competition with ‘invasive’ rabbits and predation by foxes, etc., and because Aboriginal people leaving their land due to drought, forced removal, eliminated land-management practices like controlled burns that served them well. (It’s actually so cute!?)![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&image.png)
* Words from Peruvian poet César Vallejo, from poem “El pan nuestro,” written when he was 24:
> And in the cold hours, when the earth   
> smells of human dust  
> and it is so sad,  
> I want to knock on every door  
> and beg forgiveness of whoever’s there,  
> and bake bits of fresh bread for him,  
> here, in the oven if my heart...  
* _The fair weather of the past few days was holding—salubrious might have been the word—behemoth cumulus clouds with flat bottoms and rounded shoulders in a cerulean sky, holding faint shadows in their thick folds._
* _...basking on our backs in sunlight on the great lawn there, the rain-softened ground. A Greek chorus of lorikeets, of turquoise and king parrots, of cockatoos and galahs, sailed back and forth above us, beautiful, dazzling, streaming colors, the birds babbling and calling sharply, as if they had not yet gotten the word that we were all civilised now._

### Graves Nunataks, Queen Maud Mountains, Northern Edge of the Polar Plateau, Antarctica —> Port Famine Road, Brunswick Peninsula, Shore of the Strait of Magellan, Southern Chile
* _In a few minutes the never-setting sun will break through all but the last layer of cloud cover. It will hang there, burning in the sky like a molten club, nineteen degrees above the horizon._
* _Traveling and working in Antarctica, I’m residing in the only place on Earth without an aboriginal history, a place with only the fewest threads of modern human history. An old piece in Gondwana. Inspiring, not empty. Almost everything one sees here is new. The familiar but very misleading separation between _**_human_**_ history and _**_natural_**_ history has no footing here._
* On diving at a spot where an ice shelf abuts the sea ice in McMurdo Sound: _It was like swimming through the interior of a drowned cathedral, gliding above the aisles and the nave, peering into the grottoes of side chapels, floating past the choir stalls, and rising into the domes of the ceiling bays... bathed as [the irregular geometry of the ice shelf front] was in late evening sunlight from the northwest, I felt like I was standing in the apse at Chartres, gazing up into groined vaults between the capitals of the columns, complexly curved surfaces lit by the cathedral’a clerestory window. In Antarctica there was no end to the wonder._ 
* _At the head of the Koettlitz Glacier, where the ice of the lime ice cap crowns slightly as it flows over a shoulder of bedrock, the low light of the sun was passing through the glacier’s interior. For a few moments it seemed that this part of the glacier was lit from within. The sun burned there like a lightbulb shining through a parchment shade._
* _Glacial ice fizzes and pops as it melts, releasing Earth’s atmosphere of many thousands of years ago as it burns._
* Possible explanations for mummified seals found on dry plains = **water skies,** which seals generally look for to find open water, since, _in an ice-coveted landscape, a dark patch appearing in an overcast sky reveals a place below where the light is reflecting poorly off open water, compared to the reflection of daylight off a surface of snow or ice._ However, McMurdo Sound also has a second set of dark patches, those above the snow-free dry valleys, which can trap them far from the sea. 
* _Below us all is ice, radiant under a uniform fall of direct sunlight. The frozen sea is all gray and white — the grays of fog, of smoke; the whites of gypsum. The “alleluia plain” of sunlit sea ice here carries heterogenous patches and narrow lines of dark charcoal, with dabs of light brown within the dark patches._ (Those be penguins!)
* _...I can see tints of green and turquoise in the barrier face of the ice shelf, phantom colors, some of them. The changing angle of the sun lifts these pastels out of the ice and then releases them._
* Of the view of the Southern Pole from the Skylab: _...the crusted plain of wind-wrinkled snow. Where the waist of the sky met the white plain, the air was lit by a belt the color of lapis lazuli. High above it, past succeeding shades of light blue, over the shoulders of the sky, hung a few wisps of mare’s tail cirrus, parallel to one another._
* _Some days I watched as pearly opalescence bathed an entire cloud. The interior of an abalone shell, mounted in the sky._ (**Abalone**, an edible mollusk of the warm seas lined with mother-of-pearl)
* _Beyond those far shores was the immensity of the southern horizon. The land of Tierra del Fuego and the waters beyond, where I could see them, folded over the edge of Earth here like a waterfall._
