### Introduction

- “It seems to be one of the characteristics of western man that defies rational understanding that *he prizes the lost more highly than the existing*. There is no other explanation for his curious enduring fascination with the Tasmanian tiger.”
- “*To forget everything is bad, certainly. Worse still is to forget nothing.* After all, knowledge can only be gained by forgetting. If everything is stored indiscriminately, as it is in electronic data memories, it loses its meaning and becomes a disorderly mass of useless information.”
- “*Writing*, which the Khwarezmian scholar Al-Biruni once described as a *being propagating itself in time and space*, was from the outset a system for passing on information in parallel with inheritance and irrespective of kinship. By writing, as by reading, one can pick one’s own ancestors and establish a second, intellectual hereditary line to rival conventional biological heritage.”

> Writing cannot bring anything back, but it can enable everything to be experienced.

Wherever possible, keep phenomena separate from established rules and always start with the general and work towards the individual.”
