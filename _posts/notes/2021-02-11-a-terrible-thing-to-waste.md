### Introduction

- African Americans & other marginalized communities of color = preferentially affected by environmental toxins thought to lower IQ
    - Bc more likely to live in *sacrificial zones* assaulted by poisons and hazards
    - Lack of adherence in US to *precautionary principle*, that we should expose people to chemicals if we aren’t sure they’re safe
- Addressing this injustice will be a very effective way to close racial IQ gap, thus benefitting all of America
    - Ex. effect of adding iodine to salt on IQ
- Jeremy Bentham → “The plea of impossibility offers itself at every step, in justification of injustice in all its forms.”

## Part I: Color-Coded Intelligence?

### Chapter 1: The Prism of Race

- Failure to acknowledge that racial IQ gap is not innate/hereditary, but rather very dependent on geographic & environmental factors → robs us of a tool to close the gap (and help people)
- *Intelligence* is notoriously hard to define, and not the same as the cognitive skills measured by IQ
    - Idea of comparative IQ scores is really only applicable within group of people with equivalent opportunities, motivation
    - IQ designed explicitly *not* as a predictive test, which is how it is used today, but to measure weakness of students already underperforming
- Race = social construction, but has real-world, biological consequences
    - Based on physical appearance and laws before emancipation, but often conflated with actual genetic/ancestral groupings
    - Especially mis-fitting bc so much unacknowledged mating between black and white Americans
    - Similarly, grouping Latinos and Hispanics masks a much more diverse composition
    - Asians, too, harmed by the model minority myth: stress & pressure → suicide risk, resentment from other groups, traits of intelligence/good at math & science → too calculating/not creative/no interpersonal skills

> “When it comes to exposure that limits cognition, race as a social construction becomes race as biological fate. Unless we choose to intervene.”

## Part II: The Brain Thieves

### Chapter 2: The Lead Age

- Romans infused their food/wine with lead for the sweet flavor... *plumbing* derived from Latin for lead, *plumbum* (→ Pb)
- We know lead is incredibly toxic, so why do so many African American children suffer from lead poisoning?
    - Shockingly unethical studies by KKI (associated with Hopkins) → too expensive to completely remove lead from houses, so partially did, then specifically rented homes to AA families with children to see how different levels of lead abatement affected them
- Industrial greed > public safety when in 1920s, GM chose to use fuel with lead despite cheaper, more available ethanol, so they could patent it
    - Lead inhaled by people, esp harmful to children

> “Poverty is certainly a risk factor for environmental exposure, but race is a larger and more consistent one.”

- Common pattern in response by industry in response to evidence of environmental poisoning = raising public doubts (basically, misinformation)
    - Demand (expensive) proof of danger before a ban— opposite of what the policy should be! More lives compromised, expense on healthcare system, lost IQ
    - Precautionary principle suggests proving chemical’s safety before approval, as in the EU
- Effects of lead poisoning...
    - Esp. damaging to neurodevelopment
    - Often latent, until later assault on immune system, etc. occurs
    - Childhood blood lead = predictive form disciplinary problems, juvenile and adult crime
- Poisoned water in Flint, Michigan
- “Just a 5 point IQ drop” → 57% increase in mental retardation, cuts number of “gifted” kids by half

### Chapter 3: Poisoned World

- AA and Hispanic children exposed to more polluted air than white children — closer to oil and gas facilities
- AAs + other POC 79% more likely than white Americans to live near sources IOC neurotoxicants
    - Class of undertested chemicals that poison the brain, interfere with development
- Studies focus more on environmental hazard placement wrt class, but overshadows stronger (and more shameful) connection with race
    - Ex. Middle-class blacks much more affected than poor whites
- Air pollution (gases and particulates) kill over 50k people annually even in America
    - Injure developing brains of children
    - Lead to asthma (which can reduce IQ, by hypoxia)
    - Leads to many brain disorders, intellectual and behavioral issues, mental health problems (in addition to cancer)
- Specific effects of magnetite (→ Alzheimer’s), benzene, etc. have been studied, each toxin affects cognition in different ways
- 1960s, Monsanto run-off and toxic waste (incl. PCBs) poisoned entire community in Anniston.. and they were well aware of danger of the chemicals
    - Eventual compensation from law suit was laughable, esp when compared to similar incident in Japan
- Pesticide use → huge cumulative national IQ loss, most from prenatal exposure
- Many cases of industrial waste dumped on Native American reservations — sometimes forced to accept it by economic conditions
    - Acid mine drainage, mercury released by coal-fired plants

### Chapter 4: Prenatal Policies

- Protection must begin in the womb
- Conflict in following conventional advice on breast-feeding, giving babies a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, when those are also sources of neurotoxic pollutants

> “Even very low levels of exposure can wreak cognitive havoc [during critical stages of brain development].”

- Endocrine disrupters (EDs) → interfere with hormonal signals → in addition to direct hormonal issues (including reproductive problems) causes lowered intelligence & IQ
    - Lack of evidence of risk of many chemicals due more to research vacuum and actual harmlessness
- Heavy metal exposure → drop in fertility, increase in miscarriages (see clearly in data from Flint)
- Air pollution, vermin, waterborne microbes all pose threats to pregnant mothers and babies
    - Often conditions impossible did AA families to physically escape due to housing segregation
- Problem of mercury: confusing bc elemental form is benign, but methylmercury is neurotoxic
    - But mercury can be metabolized into methylmercury by waterborne microbes, presence of other industrial waste like iron
- AAs less likely to be counseled to avoid alcohol, tobacco during pregnancy
- Very high infant mortality among blacks in America, with race >> socioeconomics as driving factor (AA lawyers and doctors more likely than whites without GED to suffer from death of infant)

### Chapter 5: Bugs in the System

- *Parasite-stress theory of intelligence:* fighting off microbial infection is metabolically expensive → interferes with brain development
- Fetal damage from Zika → physical *and* mental disease
- Only recently with new tech knowledge → draw connections btw infection & cognition
- “Neglected tropical diseases” prevalent among American poor, enclaves of AAs and Hispanics
- Infectious disease → most powerful predictor of average national IQ, controlling for other key factors
    - Explains potential mechanism of Flynn effect, which is too dramatic to be genetic
- Almost 9/10 HIV+ children are AA or Hispanic
    - Also has brain-damaging effects
- Infectious diseases often thrive due to inadequate environmental safety in at-risk communities

## Part III: Mission Possible: How to Bolster the Nation's IQ

### Chapter 6: Taking the Cure

- Prevention is key, b/c recovery from environmental poisoning is very difficult
    - Obvious solution = eradicate underregulated and harmful poisons from where people live, work and learn... but we need more then just knowledge → political solutions
    - Strong, active EPA prioritizing people > industry
    - Until then, what can individuals do to fight for a less toxic environment?
- Enroll your kids in pre-K
- Fight toxins in schools
- Poison-proof your home
- Poison-proof your water
- Avoid brain-draining contaminants in food (especially for pregnant women)
    - GRAS = "generally recognized as safe" → not specifically tested for human safety
    - Must be especially careful with children, fetuses
- Avoid heavy metals

### Chapter 7: A Wonderful Thing to Save

- Human-rights movements to protest use of toxic chemicals by industry
- Need to include marginalized communities in environmental movement
    - "Toxic environment" also includes lack of access to nature, which has many stress-reducing benefits
