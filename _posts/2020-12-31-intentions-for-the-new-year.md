### Resolutions? Intentions?

Things to try to do or keep doing starting tomorrow, but not to get super intense about? 

1. Don't keep reading books I hate. 
2. Continue finding a quote a day.
3. Create something each day.
4. Either read an article, save it, or skip itâ€” don't just scroll through.
    - ... but it's okay to skim research articles, or just to note key findings, without reading the details of every method used.
5. Formulate opinions on topics I read about.
    - ... and practice using the different writing tips I've read about this year!
6. Keep up with letter writing.
7. Run *outside* when I can. 
8. Journal three pages a day. 
9. Breathing.  Do it often. 
10. Get outside for at least 10 minutes a day. 

### By value (or, why these matter to me):

- *Authenticity*: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- *Adventure*: 3, 7
- *Connection*: 6, 10
- *Challenge*: 4
