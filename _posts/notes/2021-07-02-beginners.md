### Intro

- Author sets out to learn (but not master): chess, singing, surfing, drawing, making (wedding rings), and juggling
- Advantages of being a beginner:
    - No expectations or imposter syndrome
    - Can usually see progress faster
    - More open-minded → see possibilities others with experience cannot
- Younger brains (<20) → faster, more "intuitive" style of thinking, more reliant on intuition
    - Older people → other knowledge/experience can interfere with learning and memory retrieval
    - Fluid vs crystallized intelligence

### Lessons from Infants

- Infants learning to walk = ideal beginners— very high failure rate, yet little negative feedback; designed to not get hurt when falling… other lessons from infant learning?
    - Practice in many contexts → may be less successful, but learn more; explore variety of solutions
    - Fail often!
    - Skills rarely transfer (eg. from crawling to walking)
    - Learning can be nonlinear— can get worse before getting better
    - Operate at the edge of impossible— zone of proximal development → fastest learning
    - Take advantage of opportunities that arise; don’t stay too fixed on set goal

### Learning to Sing

- Very vulnerable to perform/sing in public— think about the last time you did so!
- Why are so many of us poor/mediocre singers?
    - Kindergarten → 6th grade, people improve at singing, but regress by college-aged— likely because less “practice”
    - Development of musical self-consciousness, despite lack of correlation btw actual performance and self-perception → people identify as “musical” or not, affecting amount of engagement (assumed to be innate talent)
- Can be therapeutic (both physical and mental)— singing activates more emotions than speaking, no one liking their own voice
    - Need to be physically relaxed to let lungs and larynx work optimally
- Often learning consists of doing less, not more— trying too hard → tension, which inhibits vocal cords
    - Replacing old habits rather than simply not doing them → less likely to revert to old ones under pressure (ex. bending down when singing high notes)
- Mimic the conditions of singing in the shower! Warm, relaxed, standing, energized

### Virtues of Learning on the Fly

- **Chorus effect:** disconnect of sound from its source when coming from many people together, resulting from combination of each individual deviating slightly from perfect pitch
- Performing in groups can lead to *social facilitation* (doing “better”) or *social loafing* (doing worse)
    - Acts as social glue: choirs usually around 50 people, ideal size; faster bonding than other groups from synchrony of singing
- Singing alone makes you feel good; singing in groups makes you feel even better— lowers cortisol, ups oxytocin
- Choirs → ideal learning environment: many people to observe, immediate feedback, motivation to contribute
    - Unique skill to sing in choir than alone, though! Different focus

### The Challenges of the Advanced Beginner (Surfing!)

- Classic beginner mistake = looking at ourselves vs where we want to be going— surfing, biking
    - Across most skills, do better if focusing on external goal vs ourselves— in golf, thinking about the hole vs elbow; in music, overall sound vs hands
- Initially, beginners adhere to context-free rules; to become advanced beginner, start incorporating context
    - Leads to *U-shaped learning curve*— learning gets harder after beginning; start to know what you don’t know, can overgeneralize rules
- Goes to Simply Surf!
- Third (of five) stage after beginner, advanced beginner, is *competent* → emotional and personal involvement in success or failure (not just a result of you knowing or not knowing something)
    - Can be okay with staying at this stage— if the skill (ex. surfing) is more an enthusiasm than a job, want to improve as long as it keeps being fun

### How We Learn to Do Things (Juggling)

- Juggling = often studied in science of learning— right difficulty, easy to measure
- As we get better at a skill, become more efficient with use of muscles; not as much memorizing the physical motion as the mental patterns
- Repetition without repetition → important to practice in different contexts, solving the problem again each time rather than mastering one solution
- Motivation/desire to learn → learn more from observation (one of best ways to pick up a skill; necessary but not sufficient)
    - Also need someone watching you— getting both positive and negative feedback
- Being a beginner, regardless of skill, age, and progress, leads to increase in neuroplasticity

### Learning to Draw

- Not a motor skill, but a thinking one: learning to draw what we actually see, rather than in categorical prototypes
- Could be considered equal to reading in terms of things people should learn → gives us *visual literacy* in addition to verbal
- To draw precision drawing, start with *envelope* to set up basic geometric proportions, add high and low points
    - Abstract everything— see curves as series of small lines
