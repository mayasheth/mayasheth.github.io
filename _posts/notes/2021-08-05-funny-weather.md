## Intro

- Collection of essays and criticisms of artwork, mainly from last half century

## Artists’s Lives

- **Jean-Michel Basquiat** → New York artist, started off in graffiti, collab with Warhol
- [**Agnes Martin**](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/agnes-martin/who-is-agnes-martin) → first works = grids, then painted, carefully-planned stripes of pastels; almost all abstract except very last drawing of a plant
- **[David Hockney](https://www.hockney.com/works/paintings/60s)** → one of Britain’s most famous artists, reinvented and explored many media and themes (swimming pools, LA, etc.)
    - Always learning to look, remembering that looking brings joy
- **Joseph Cornell** → boxes, collages (Surrealist?), movie-making
    - Collab with Yayoi Kusama
- **Robert Rauschenberg** → “combines,” the film Rocky
- **Georgia O’Keefe** → took one subject matter and painted it over and over to truly understand: flowers, wall with a door, cow skull
- **Derek Jarman** → Modern Nature, on gardening
    - It’s how we all go, in and out of the dark— but what a thing it is to have given off such a blaze (something like that, from *Song of Solomon*)

## Freeze Columns

- Protest form of stitched-mouths: silence = death, in response to AIDS and refugee crisis
- Art less about making objects than opening conversations
- Ali Smith’s writing = epitome of “and, and, and”

### Essays

- On Maggie Nelson’s *The Argonauts*— like much of her work, defies classification by genre; uses personal experiences to analyze culture, how obsessed we are to binaries
- What is the job or task of the artist? There is none: the duty of an artist is to be free.
